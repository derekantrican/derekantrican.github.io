    "content": "9/30: (ZERO) Again, I shouldn't have written about this zero before it happened. My intention was to take the Chelan ferry down to Chelan and get a ride that same day up to Winthrop. I was hoping to find someone heading to Winthrop on the ferry and I did....but they were going a couple days later. Instead, someone else offered to let me stay in the extra room of the cabin at the resort they were staying at! So I stayed with them in Chelan and it was awesome! Shower, salmon for dinner, watching the sunrise from the dock, etc!<br />\n<br />\n10/1: (15.5 miles) The nice trail angels that let me stay with them last night were also kind enough to drive me to Pateros, WA. Then it was hitching from there. It took me about an hour and someone finally picked me up on their way home. Fortunately he was able to take me about 28 miles towards Winthrop. Unfortunately, it was still 6 miles to the nearest town. After another half hour, someone picked me up and drove me those 6 miles into Twisp. ~20 minutes of hitching later someone drove me into Winthrop where I was able to pick up my box of food and get lunch from the grocery store. Then I hitched for another half hour just to get driven to the other end of town, but someone picked me up immediately after that, taking me to Mazama, WA (the closest town to the trail). I was trying to hitch into Hart's Pass (the nearest road access to the US/Canada border) so that I could be done with the PCT soon. After about an hour and a half of hitching (everyone was friendly and waving, but no one was offering to drive me any distance whatsoever) I <i>finally</i>&nbsp;got a ride up to the pass. Starting at around 4:30pm, I hiked just over 15 miles today of classic Washington before camping late (just about 10pm). Fortunately, this would be my last night sleeping on the PCT!<br />\n<br />\n10/2: (25.5 miles) Got going as early as I could stand with the cold (8am) and pushed hard today! I hiked quickly and it was difficult because of the long hill immediately out of camp. But after that the hills were either gradual or flat and I was able to get going pretty quickly. So quickly, in fact, that by the time I stopped for lunch at 1pm, I was only 2.8 miles from the border! I had gone 14 miles! I had \"freeze-dried\" (or \"powdered\") cheesecake for lunch that another hiker had given me and it was ehh...pretty good. Then I hiked quickly to the border. I got there and I was the only one around (I had seen other hikers coming back from the border, through) so I did some selfies with the monuments and hiked on into <u style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CANADA</u>! A couple hundred feet into Canada I realized that I never signed a trail register at the border, so I went back to look for it. I searched all around and couldn't find it. The perfectionist in me decided to try to fix the off-kilter top half of the metal monument (check out my pictures) and it <i>fell off</i>! Apparently the top comes off and the trail register was inside! Sneaky, sneaky. I signed it, replaced it, and heaved the very heavy top half of the monument back into place (leaving it slightly off-kilter on purpose so that the next person would find it). Then I hiked on into Canada (it was about 2:45pm). I passed a couple hikers that were camping just past the border, but I pressed on and over the last long, slippery, and annoying hill (and down the other side) before I finally got to the road (and then to Manning Park Lodge). Unfortunately, they were fully booked but they had hostel rooms available. All along, \"hostel\" has meant \"bunkhouse\" but this actually meant \"your own room with your own bed, it's just super tiny and not decorated or anything\" which was fine by me! All night long as I was drifting in and out of sleep I had these dreams that I was still hiking. Oh boy, this might take a while to \"decompress\".",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">\n[This last section was probably the most annoying section. It is the longest section on the PCT (5 full days between towns), full of steep up and downs, bushes encroaching on the trail that you have to constantly force your way through, and plenty of logs across the trail to climb over or even crawl under. Wasn't exactly my idea of \"fun\"]</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n9/25: (16.9 miles) I packed up my stuff at the Dinsmore's this morning and Mr. Dinsmore took us to Skykomish to get breakfast. After fully stuffing our faces, I went over to use the library's WiFi because the restaurant's and the Dinsmore's WiFis were atrociously slow (rule of thumb- the library always has good WiFi). I hung around with the other couple hikers at the restaurant until about noon when I decided to finally pull myself out of the vortex. The Skykomish deli has a sign for hitching that reads \"PCT HIKER NEEDS RIDE TO STEVEN'S PASS\" in nice, big, readable letters. They call it a magical sign and boy, were they right! I hauled out the sign and my pack near the highway and by the time I had set down my pack to get ready to hold up the sign, a car pulled up offering a ride. Easiest hitch ever! I quickly ran back in to return the sign, then hopped in the car. Up at the pass, the fog was as dense as could be (we could hardly see where to turn left for the trailhead). Fortunately it was easy-going for the first bit of hiking. Then Washington's familiar ups and downs. When I was about 12 miles in, I was walking up a switchback when a black bear ran across the trail about 50 feet in front of me! 1st bear in about 1800 miles! By the time I was within 2 miles of my planned camp spot, it had been dark for a while and I had been walking by headlamp. But the headlamp wasn't doing me much good with the dense fog, so I stopped early. Got my cooking water from a rain puddle (desperate times) and set up camp in the drizzling rain.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br />\n9/26: (23.7 miles) Today I had to make up that extra 1.3 miles that I missed yesterday. Uphills and downhills were abundant! Today was mostly overcast but at one point the sun came out. It was around 1pm and I started to stop for lunch. About 25min into my lunch, some rain picked up (with a bit of snow mixed in) and I had to quickly pack up everything I had set out to dry and dash out of there. So today wasn't the best. I <i>did</i>&nbsp;make up the extra 1.3 miles but I was still camping at a high elevation and it was quite cold.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br />\n9/27: (22 miles) Today I will dub the \"Day of Slipping and Falling\". As I mentioned above, I was at high elevation and it was <i>very</i>&nbsp;cold. In fact, so cold that even after the sun had been out for at least half an hour, my tent was still covered in stiff sheets of ice. I tried to wait for it to thaw out but eventually I had to get going so I just did my best to roll it up (inevitably rolling some ice up in it). This of course made my hands freezing and every minute or so I had to stop to warm up my hands. At around 9:50am I was finally packed up and ready to hike. So far there has been plenty of mud on the trails due to the rain on the first day and this makes for some creative hiking where I have to walk on the side of the trail, hop across rocks, etc. Today was further complicated with the trail being literally frozen (in places the whole trail was just a big sheet of ice). So I inevitably slipped and fell on that a couple times. Also, a couple times I had to cross logs over creeks or climb over logs that had fallen across the trail. Turns out that wet logs are very slimy and slippery as well (so that accounts for a couple more falls right there). And, at one other point, I was walking along a ridge line and the ground under my left foot gave way and I nearly fell off the trail (but caught myself and instead fell <i>on</i>&nbsp;the trail). Finally, I took a shortcut (0.5 miles cutting off 1.5 miles) on the old PCT where a bridge used to be but got washed out. Crossing the river there was fine but the trail to the old bridge was washed out too and I did somewhat of a \"controlled fall\" and slid down the dirt embankment. Needless to say, I was not happy that I was hiking the PCT at this point.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n9/28: (20.9 miles) So that number reads \"20.9\" but if you mark my start and end points today, you'd see that I hiked about 27 miles today. Shortcuts are awesome. Today got going slow and within the first half hour of my hiking I wanted to be done. I was able to convince myself to push on and finally got to the downhill section. Today's big mission is basically a TON of downhill and a TON of uphill, then camp on the other side of that hill. But I noticed there was a junction where the old PCT used to go <i>again</i>&nbsp;(and again it was because a bridge got washed out and they built a newer one downstream). But this time, if I took the shortcut, I would spend 1 mile cutting off about 6 miles! Definitely taking it. So I forded a creek (took off my socks and shoes and all that) and had lunch on the other side. Fortunately the old PCT was easy to follow because it was still very worn (and I think some other people have had the same idea as me because some parts looked well-worn recently). I got through to the other side and the river where the bridge used to be actually seemed like a pretty dangerous ford (there weren't any obvious spots to cross and there was lots of water moving <i>fast</i>). But after about 20 minutes of hunting, I finally found a log to walk across (didn't slip and fall this time) and made it across to the PCT! Then from there on out I was able to put in ~3 mph up the hill and down the other side. Camping tonight was freaky. I was with two other tents in this wooded area and at around 9:30pm we heard big sounds right outside. There were at least 3 creatures and they sounded <i>big</i>. They were tromping all around our tents, breaking twigs underfoot, etc. One sounded like a bear trying to get someone's food in a bear canister. My food was in my tent with me and I was entirely freaked out. But in the morning one of the other hikers informed me that they were a group of stupid deer that where just walking around our campsite. &lt; 100 miles to Canada!</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br />\n9/29: (14.5 miles) I <i>BOOKED IT</i>&nbsp;today. I heard that the shuttle into Stehekin has changed to the Fall schedule so that the last bus runs at 3pm (turns out this was wrong), so I wanted to make it there by then. I hiked about 3.5 mph the whole morning, leaving at 8am and arriving just before 1pm. It averaged out to ~3.1 mph because I had to stop to eat or filter water a couple times. When I got to the ranger station I found out I had just missed the latest bus (the 12:45pm) by <i>minutes</i>. I was frustrated, but not too bad because I had planned on the 3pm anyway. But the nearby Stehekin Ranch picked me up in a shuttle and dropped me off at their place (only 2 miles away) where I could wait for the bus and use their molasses-ly slow WiFi. The bus came a couple hours later and I took it all the way down to Stehekin (it's about a 15min ride, but the bus stops at the famous bakery so that we can get some goodies). I hung around Stehekin for a while (hotel room was $135! so I camped for free), ate at the restaurant (very overpriced: $18 for an \"ok\" burger), and then set up camp.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br />\n9/30: (ZERO) Today the plan is to take the ferry from Stehekin down to Chelan (down the 54 mile-long Chelan lake), enjoy the ferry ride, then get a ride up to Winthrop from Chelan (Winthrop is the last town stop in Washington). I'll stay at the hostel in Winthrop and then get a ride to Hart's Pass (the last road access to the PCT before Canada) tomorrow (which will leave about 2 days of hiking to Manning Park, Canada). I'm skipping ~2 days of hiking between Stehekin and Hart's Pass because at this point I pretty much just want to be done with the PCT. If I was in California right now (and maybe Oregon), I'd probably just quit. But this closer to the border, I gotta finish it off. Here we go!</div>\n",

    "content": "9/21: (11.7 miles) Today I hiked out of Snoqualmie Pass. It was hard to get going and I was really getting vortexed! I finally got out of there around 2:30pm and started hiking around 3pm. Lots and lots of uphill ahead of me. I got going way too late and had to stop early. I was intending to do about 15 miles today but it was already dark and around 8pm before I found a good spot to camp. Because I was on top of a mountain, it was pretty chilly. Was really, <i>really</i>&nbsp;tired and didn't even want to cook dinner, so I just ate a spoonful of Nutella and went to sleep.<div>\n<br />9/22: (24.6 miles) When I woke up today, it was so cold that the light mist had frozen my tent into stiff sheets of ice. But fortunately it warmed up soon. Today I had to make up for yesterday's \"missed\" miles. I hiked up lots of loose rock, then down the other side. Plenty of beautiful views today! Lunch was down in the valley before the next big uphill. The uphill was large and intimidating but I had podcasts on my side! Unfortunately, I only had two podcasts left (16 GB phone) and ran out before I reached the top of the hill. And I still had the next downhill ahead of me. So I hiked down the next big downhill as quickly as I could until I couldn't see where I was stepping. Then I put on my jacket and headlamp and kept hiking. Lots of nostalgic Relient K accompanied me down that hill (see this post's title). Camped near the Waptus River today.</div>\n<div>\n<br />9/23: (19.8 miles) Ah, an easy day. But, unfortunately, I didn't feel like hiking at all. My first break happened within the first 45 min of hiking and my second break was hardly an hour after that. I was eventually able to push myself to hike the rest of the way today. Slow going the whole day and I kept wanting to take a break (but there was no reason, nor time to do so). I made it to camp after dark at a wonderful campsite next to Deception Lake. Nice, soft grass everywhere. So appealing that I actually sat there for a moment, then went barefoot in order to set up my tent. Unfortunately, a nice water source and nice, soft grass comes with a price: mice. Lots of mice all around my tent and some crawled into my tent only to scurry around panicked for a few minutes because they didn't know their way out. Freaking annoying.</div>\n<div>\n<br />9/24: (7.1 miles) Ah, the day of shortcuts. Immediately from my campsite I took a shortcut that was a little steeper than the PCT (and definitely more rocky and treacherous on the downhill), but it cut off about 2 miles. Then, about a mile later, I took the wonderful shortcut to the highway. It was 5 miles of steep downhill (cutting off 9 miles of PCT-ness), but I hiked it with a couple of other hikers and we talked the whole way. We got a ride from a nice couple we met on the way down and they drove us into Skykomish. Here in Skykomish we got burgers and milkshakes at the Cascadia Inn &amp; Cafe where the famous trail angel Mr. Dinsmore (of the Dinsmore's Hiker Haven) happened to be eating at the time. The waitress tipped us off and he's giving us a ride back to his place momentarily. Bed, shower, and laundry tonight!</div>\n",

    "content": "<br />9/17: (25.8 miles) Today I got picked up from the Packwood Inn quite early (7am) by a friend of the guy who picked me up from the trail and dropped me off here the day before. I had originally planned ~20 miles for this day, but it started raining/drizzling/snowing all day and (as I always do when hiking in weather like this)- I didn't want to take breaks. So I ended up hiking without stopping at ~3.2mph. About 12pm I was looking for a place for lunch (I usually have lunch around 1:30pm) and I found a nice big dry spot (it had been raining, but not too bad). I sat down and realized I had gone nearly 14 miles already! Way ahead of schedule! And the sun was peaking through a couple clouds at that point. So with the added Vitamin D (what I'd like to just dub \"visible motivation\"), I decided to add ~6 miles to today's total so that I can stay at the Mike Urich cabin tomorrow night (this is the only backcountry shelter on the PCT in Washington). I grabbed an extra Snickers bar from my food for lunch and kept hiking- basically only stopping once until Dewey Lake. I had to set up my tent in some light rain, but I made it!<div>\n<br />9/18: (26.7 miles) It was a lot nicer today! When I got out of my tent around 8am, the sun was already dissipating some of the clouds. I left just before 9 and hiked up the next hill and 3.2 miles from my camping spot to Chinook Pass and highway 410. This is the entrance to Mt. Rainier park (which we've been skirting in and out of the border of for the last 10 miles or so). Just after the highway there were some pit toilets at a parking lot (which I took full advantage of). Then it was another long hiking of ups and downs (welcome to WA)- this time on lots of loose rock. The key to hiking for a long time while shrugging it off like it was nothing (what some might call \"getting in the zone\") is podcasts: lots of podcasts. The day was pretty nice and sunny till around 5 or 6pm when it started sprinkling. But by 7pm I had made a new distance record and was indoors! Mice inside the cabin too (that's pretty much a guarantee in a backcountry shelter) but I still slept reasonably well.</div>\n<div>\n<br /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img height=\"192\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rf8sNKN.jpeg\" width=\"320\" /></div>\n<div>\n<br />9/19: (19.1 miles) You know, I thought it'd be easier to get up earlier this morning because I wouldn't be freezing cold (causing me to spend an extra hour or two just laying in my sleeping bag). But it was still hard. This was definitely a vortex. But I started hiking just before 8:30am (which is probably an \"early record\" for all of WA). Today was a fairly nice day of overcast with a sprinkle of sunbeams. Water was scarce today so we had to do some larger water carries (2L at one point and 3L at another), but fortunately most of the day was downhill. As in the style of the PNW, it sprinkled on and off all day, but we got to camp at the nice and early time of 5:30pm! I was with 3 other hikers and we built a campfire and chilled till dark. It rained tonight and some water pooled inside my tent because the puddles near my tent splashed from the raindrops- but it was fine.</div>\n<div>\n<br />9/20: (9.1 miles) Had to pack up in the light rain today. That's always annoying. Probably more annoying than setting up camp in the rain because my tent is one of the first things that has to be packed in my backpack- so everything else has to sit outside while I tear down the tent. But I got going around 9:20am and struggled up the first hill. Rain pants and a rain jacket protect you from getting wet via water from the sky, but up big hills they don't prevent you from getting wet via your own sweat (they don't breathe well). But by about 10:30 or 11:30 the rain had mostly stopped. At 11:45 I took a break and was consulting my maps when two things happened: I got 3G and I found a shortcut! The original plan was to hike another 22 miles today, then 5 into town tomorrow morning but this would cut it even shorter! When I got to the dirt road where I was going to break away and head down to I-90, I saw about 5 other hikers that I had been hiking with and a nice trail angel that was cooking taco soup, beer bread, cookies, etc for everyone! Score! And, because of hunting season, the traffic was pretty good on this road! So instead of hiking 4 miles down the dirt road to the I-90 on ramp, I hitched here and got a ride from some more mushroom hunters all the way to Snoqualmie Pass! Stayed in the Summit Inn last night in a hotel room! Dried my gear out all over the room and definitely took advantage of the hot tub! I'm now a day ahead of schedule. Canada, here I come!</div>\n",

And, also, I'm pretty tired (and am leaving early in the morning)]</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/13: (10.4 miles) This morning I had breakfast at the Country Inn and after a shower and a final packing of supplies, I got a ride back to the trail. At the trailhead there was a nice couple waiting for a hiker friend of theirs with treats and goodies (which they invited me and some other hikers to take part in). Chocolate bars, ice cream, fruit! I started hiking and camped on the side of Mt. Adams. It got quite cold this night!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/14: (21.6 miles) Got going late this morning as it was REALLY cold. I left camp around 9:45. Soon after starting it began to snow. Very light, harmless snow but around 11am it was cold enough (and snowing hard enough) to start coating everything. I quickly put on rain pants and headed out. As I dropped in elevation, snow turned to rain and eventually the rain stopped altogether. But it continued to be freezing cold all day long. I camped around dusk at a spot that had much less water than I would like (but still enough).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/15: (21.6 miles) Again, going late because of the cold. No snow at all today, just freezing cold all day. Today was plenty of uphill. Had to go over Cispus Pass (not too hard. Just lots of work uphill). Also, Goats Rocks and something called the Knife's Edge. Yeah. VERY freaky. Walking over lots of loose rocks and snow on steep uphills/downhills where the path is about one foot wide and either side is a steep drop off. And did I mention the freezing wind? Yeah, the freezing wind. (See the picture below for \"freaky factor\"). After all that I rushed down the rest of the hill to get to my planned camping spot (next to a lake).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/16: (12.3 miles) Nice morning. Got up at 7 and couldn't see my breath so that was a good sign. Got going by 8:30! Today is town day so I was eager to get there. In fact, so eager that I only took one break in the 12.3 miles of hiking today. I got to the highway right at 1pm and got picked up within the half hour and taken down to Packwood, WA. Paid $65 for a hotel room and I've been chilling in here since. Gotta head out early tomorrow!</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8PAHXczo3ck/Vfpd9AR4kmI/AAAAAAAAQ2o/narvAEmkrno/s1600/IMG_20150915_173942016.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"> <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8PAHXczo3ck/Vfpd9AR4kmI/AAAAAAAAQ2o/narvAEmkrno/s640/IMG_20150915_173942016.jpg\"> </a> </div>",

Stopping by home for a while pulled me out of the hiker state of mind and the snow directly after that discouraged me even more. But after talking to Shameless and Pudding, I think all us hikers are down here at the bottom of Motivation Canyon- we just want to be done. Every day ends with \"I don't want to do this anymore. Maybe I'll just go back home when I get to the next town.\" But I keep reminding myself that I'm in Washington and can't quit so close to Canada. Again, I think that's what's on every hiker's mind at this point.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fires look like they've cleared up pretty much everywhere that's important to us- Stehekin, Mt.

    "title": "Hiking is full of up and downs",
    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">9/8: (5.9 miles) Because of the bad weather I experienced in Oregon, I decided to jump up to Cascade Locks and start Washington. I spent the night with my aunt in Portland, then headed out the next afternoon to Cascade Locks. At around 5pm I hiked over the Bridge of the Gods (a freaky, all-metal bridge with no room for pedestrians). I started my hike out of the Columbia Gorge and it was <i>beautiful</i>! I was more or less hiking through a rainforest (minus the rain). It was the most lush, dense, and \"undergrowth-full\" forest I think I've ever seen! Around 8pm I set up camp and went to bed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/9: (14.2 miles) It's SO HARD to get up early when the sun is muffled by the thick tree canopy. The light is dim and the air is still cool (even around 9am). Because I did part of today's miles yesterday I didn't have quite the rush this morning (so I got up at 9). Unfortunately, getting out of the gorge isn't just one big hill and you're done. Washington is notorious for its big ups and downs. For the next couple days I'll be going up and down 2000 feet at a time (it's like the Sierras but at a lower elevation). Fortunately most of today was spent in the shade thanks to the dense canopy (see above), but Washington still gets plenty hot (it's pretty humid). I camped tonight at a nice creek but got \"attacked\" all night by tiny mice. Eventually (about 1:30am) I threw my food outside my tent (it's in a rodent-proof bag) and slept. Now I probably have close to 10 half-dollar-sized chew holes in my tent. Yay.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/10: (19.7 miles) More up and down today. In fact, until lunch I had about 2000 feet to go up then down the other side. On the way I met up with a hiker I've known for a while- Pudding. We hiked together down to the bottom of the hill and had lunch down there where Pudding's hiking partner Shameless met up with us. We leapfrogged the next 5 miles or so to the Panther Creek Campground and I left them to continue up the next hill (but not before filling up an extra 2 L of water for the night). I set up next to a dirt road and put my food bag outside this time. I then proceeded to sleep like a rock tonight!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/11: (21.9 miles) About 45 min after leaving my campsite this morning (I got up around 8 and left around 8:45) Shameless and Pudding caught up to me again. Which is good because I can pretty easily slack off when hiking by myself. Pudding and Shameless hike pretty close to my pace but they take way less breaks than I do. We met some people from Portland out on the trail with their llamas (I uploaded a picture to the Google Drive of them). They were just out for the weekend. We had lunch at a dirt road and \"parking lot\" where there were picnic tables and a pit toilet (locked, of course). After the nice long lunch I headed up the next hill by myself and fortunately this one I didn't have to go all the way down the other side (we more or less stayed up). I met lots of weekenders from Portland (no one from anywhere else- strange) around Blue Lake and Lemei Lake on the way to the campsite. I pushed past my campsite and camped with Shameless and Pudding at Deer Lake. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/12: (10.0 miles) Again, hard to get up this morning. Shameless and Pudding left just before 7am and I didn't get out of bed till 8. Today was town day and I had 20 miles till the \"proper\" road to hitch into town. But since I'm a little lazy, I went 6.2 miles to a \"parking lot\" and gravel road. After an hour I'd had a couple cars stop but no one going to Trout Lake. 3.8 miles later I stopped at a paved road for lunch. After half an hour I had seen only one car going my way (not far enough) but they said there were a few cars at a parking lot next to a lake a couple hundred feet down the road. I walked there and there was one woman who said they were mushroom hunting for the next couple hours and were all going down into Trout Lake! So I sat and read my kindle for the couple hours and during that time one car pulled up and gave me a chocolate bar! The group got back and the leader (a retried mycology professor who does these outings a couple times a year at $50/person- donating the money to charity) gave me a ride down to pick up my box and find me a place to stay. All the rooms everywhere were booked for an event this weekend but a woman named Mary who bakes the desserts for the Country Inn put me up at her barn which is fully renovated for barn dances, weddings, and other parties. It was marvelous! Back on trail tomorrow...</p>\n",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">9/4: (13.7 miles) Last night we had travelled to Salem, OR to see my sister and this morning we were on the way back. The car was packed with my dad, step-aunt, and I plus our packs and a bunch of stuff to take to Bend from Salem. I got my free birthday Starbucks and we headed out. About 2 hours later we reached the trailhead at Santiam Pass. My dad and I put on our packs and started off. Most of the day was a nice jolly hike with just the occasional sprinkle of rain, but a couple miles before our planned campsite the snow started. It wasn't too bad until we got near the lake where we were camping- then it really picked up and it was freezing. We quickly set up our 2 person tent and jumped inside. After about half an hour of \"relaxing\" we made dinner, then argued about how we were going to sleep in the tent (fortunately there ended up being plenty of room). We were both shivering in our sleeping bags and didn't sleep very well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9/5: (~15 miles) We got up around 7:20 (pretty late for us because we usually get going at 6:30) and slowly started packing up our stuff. It was still snowing and VERY cold. My dad decided to skip breakfast while I made breakfast in the tent (he was standing outside because..... actually I still don't know why). We begrudgingly folded up the tent (which is very hard to do with numb hands) and went on our \"merry\" way. Almost immediately we were walking along the top of an exposed ridge (with only lifeless trees for cover) in a couple inches of snow where the freezing wind was blasting our left sides with snow. Fun times. We finally got cover in some woods and that was most of the morning. We heard from a couple other hikers about a possible campground ahead but it would turn a 20 mile day into a 24 mile day (that my dad wasn't feeling capable of). But we saw a sign later with a map of a limited entry area containing Pamelia Lake. My dad remembered that you could get to Pamelia Lake from Highway 20 and I knew that the junction was in only ~5 miles. So we texted my step mom and she picked us up at the Pamelia Lake Trail at 3. Now I'm back in Bend after a shower, sleeping in a bed again, eating BBQ, and doing many things I NEVER thought I'd be doing when I was hiking this morning. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[Future Plans]: While this storm was supposedly a freak storm and the weather should be fine, in the next couple days I'll be skipping up to Portland, then to Cascade Locks and starting Washington. The weather looks like it'll cooperate and I can always come back and do this section of Oregon (especially since my parents live so close to where I got off).</p>\n",

    "content": "8/28: (6.5 miles) Today my mom and I spent some time around the Odell Lake Resort using WiFi, eating breakfast, the classic resupply stop things. We drove down to a laundromat a couple miles away (thank you mankind for making cars) at a RV Park. Around noon we loaded 3 other hikers we had met nearby (Sacagawea, Chatty Kathy, and Blue- who were hitching up to Cascade Locks for a \"fair\" called \"Trail Days\") and my mom dropped me off at the trailhead crossing of Highway 58 where I met my uncle. My mom was taking the other 3 hikers back to Salem with her and they had someone meet them from Portland to take them to Cascade Locks. My uncle and I started hiking from the highway and made it about 6 miles past the Rosary Lakes to the Maiden Peak Shelter that night. Fortunately we were indoors for the night because it rained pretty hard! There were 9 hikers in total in that shelter that night. [Also- I forgot to check in with my GPS this night (probably because I didn't have to set up my tent) so....sorry about that]<br />\n<br />\n8/29: (22.6 miles) My uncle and I headed out this morning and had to deal with a slight bit of sprinkling (not really too bad). The major downer of today was that it was bitter cold and windy <i>all day</i>. We hiked about 3 miles to the junction with the Eugene to PCT trail, then took that about 2 miles to the nearest road. My uncle's girlfriend had camped there and picked us up there. I refilled on some beautiful no-filtration-needed water from their car and they drove me up to Charlton Lake (skipping about 7.9 miles of the trail- really about 5.9 if you count the 2 miles I hiked to the road). The rest of the day from here was just bitter cold and windy. Thanks to the \"boost\" from my uncle I was able to do more miles than I had originally planned on that day (putting me now ~10 miles from Elk Lake Resort instead of ~15). I set up camp at Horseshoe Lake that night around 8pm and just barely avoided the start of the rain.<br />\n<br />\n8/30: (10.5 miles) It rained all night off and on but here's the thing about Oregon rain: it rarely \"torrential downpours\"- most of the time it just drizzles. That morning I wasted time getting out of my tent because....packing up in the rain is not one of my fortes (nor favorite interests). There were still a few dry spots under some trees nearby so I set my stuff there while I packed up my tent (my tent has to be one of the first 3 objects to go in my backpack because of the way I pack it). When I went to move some of these objects into my backpack, I found that I had the extreme misfortune of placing my stuff on a yellow jacket nest. Wahoo. Moving my stuff disturbed them and apparently they had a real interest in my hat (which was on the ground at this point) and started \"kamikaze-ing\" it. Hundreds of bees were swarming around the area and at least fifty of them were fully interested in attacking my hat for about half an hour. Apparently the rain meant nothing to them. Finally they calmed down and I quickly grabbed my hat and the other important things and shoved them in my backpack before heading out. (I left a SmartWater bottle and pen behind because they were literally on top of the nest and hmm....Leave no Trace....or....get stung? Sorry LNT advocates, but I'd rather just have my hands be cold this morning and not throbbing with other forms of pain). I hiked the ~10 miles to Elk Lake Resort in drizzling rain, extreme cold, and wind continuously (only stopping for about 5 minutes for a stupid, damp break). Fortunately Elk Lake Resort was still doing their breakfast buffet at 11:45 when I showed up and my family picked me up at 4pm for the start of my birthday zeros! Talk to you guys later!",

    "content": "8/23: (8.4 miles) Today my dad joined me! I got up, packed up, and made sure I was at the Mazama Restaurant when it opened (7am). I had 2 pancakes (Really, Mazama? Who doesn't have chocolate chips?), 3 eggs, and bacon. Around 9:45 my dad and step mom showed up and we drove a detour around the fire closure on the PCT (the PCT is closed from the North connection to the Rim Trail up until Highway 138). We had lunch (burgers and milkshake) on the way and started just after noon. I've hiked through plenty of \"wildfire smoke areas\" before, but the smoke was so thick here that you could smell it (which I didn't mind- campfire smoke is my favorite smell), but it also burned your throat after breathing it. Fortunately, we camped at a higher elevation where the smoke wasn't an issue. My dad did a great job keeping up with my 3mph pace, but I made sure we started with a low day.<br />\n<br />\n8/24: (16.7 miles) Today was our biggest day. And we really had no choice because we went from one water source (Thielsen Creek) to the next water source (Horse Spring). We carried 3 liters of water each and were still able to keep up the 3mph pace. In the last hour before the campsite my dad got service (he has AT&amp;T and I have Sprint/roaming on Verizon. I have a couple bars almost all over the trail). So he took an hour or so to make some phone calls related to work. We got to the campsite and relaxed before the big hike down to water (~0.5 miles off trail and down ~300 ft in elevation). If it weren't the latest water in 16 miles, I wouldn't have done it. After filling up on water we set up camp and went to bed.<br />\n<br />\n8/25: (15.3 miles) Detour day. We heard a bit the previous day about an alternate trail (the Oregon Skyline Trail) that cuts off ~8 miles of the PCT and dumps you out right at Shelter Cove Resort (whereas if you take the PCT, you have to do a 2 mile road walk or side trail to get to Shelter Cove). The main hiking app I use (\"Guthook's Guide\") knows nothing about this alternate. Fortunately I have my paper maps (which have a whole separate section for the alternate) and the Halfmile app that has the GPS waypoints (and will tell me if I'm on the trail or not and how far along the trail I am). The trail was tough, but I like to imagine the part of the PCT we skipped was tougher. We made it to the Cresent Lake campground (water spigots!) and basically relaxed there all day. I set up my hammock and both my dad and I read for most of the afternoon. At about dusk- as we were cooking dinner- a guy from another campsite where there was a large group camping came over and offered us chicken fajitas. Of course we said \"yes!\" Just as it was dark and we were laying in tents going to sleep a couple hikers came by and joined us at our site. They cooked dinner, set up their tent, and shined their headlamps everywhere. Not cool- but we couldn't really complain too much.<br />\n<br />\n8/26: (11.2 miles) Today we made breakfast and left camp before the other hikers got up. We did our miles easily and made it to Shelter Cove Resort by lunchtime! Unfortunately, all Shelter Cove Resort has for food (other than grocery-type food) are hotdogs, pizza (they had <i>one</i>&nbsp;option- spinach and mushroom), and breakfast burritos. So we had hotdogs. Later we had one of the pizzas for dinner (it was <i>alright</i>) and a full bottle of Martenelli's that we split. We spent most of our time at Shelter Cove Resort being frustrated with the speed of the WiFi. It sucked. Then we left for the hiker campsite and set up our tents.<br />\n<br />\n8/27: (ZERO) My dad is getting picked up today by my step-mom and my mom is coming to meet me here. We're hanging out at Odell Lake Resort where she's reserved one of their \"hotel rooms\". Shower, laundry, <u>good WiFi</u><i style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">,</i>&nbsp;here I come!<br />\n<br />\n[If you can identify what the title of this post is taken from WITHOUT GOOGLING, bonus points to you]",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">8/21: (23.4 miles) My family dropped me off at the trail at about 8:20am and I started hiking. Today was another non-eventful day of hiking. But I did figure out the secret to doing lots of miles without batting an eye: podcasts. I usually hike an hour at a time then take breaks in between the hours so hour-long podcasts are great! I'm listening to TED Talks (which is sometimes lacking when it's only audio), VergeCast (by The Verge), and Serial (a true story about trying to prove a \"murderer's\" innocence on a case that happened 15 years ago). I only hiked one hour today without listening to a podcast. When I set up camp I met a couple who is section-hiking Oregon. They had too much food so they gave me lots of candy bars, dinner they had already cooked, etc!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8/22: (26 miles) New record! Today was a lot of annoying ups and downs. Again, nothing too out of the ordinary. Didn't have any podcasts left. I did see one day hiker talking to some other PCTers and was told by the PCTers that he is Billy Goat- a thru-hiker legend. Apparently he's done the PCT around 7 times (starting in '89), the AT around 3 times and the CDT around 3 times! He's logged over 43,000 miles of thru-hikes! This night I reached Crater Lake and Mazama Village! WAY too many hikers here (~40!). Fortunately most of them will be far ahead of me when I take my birthday zeros. Camped at the $5 hiker site in the campground. I start hiking with my dad tomorrow!</p>\n",

    "content": "8/17: (0.8 miles...<i>yeah</i>) Today I hung out in the hostel for most of the morning. I packed up my stuff and set it out of the way, then headed off to the library to do some computer usage. Afterwards I went back to the hostel and hung out in the common room. I found out that I chose to send my box to the Green Springs Inn (which is closer to the PCT, but after Ashland). I wanted to sort through my box while I was still in town so a guy at the Green Springs Inn said he'd bring the box back to Ashland when he got off work, but that wouldn't be till around 4pm. So I hung out longer in the hostel. Check out time was 11am and I hung out there till around....2pm. Yeah. They eventually kicked me out and I went to seek somewhere else I could leave my pack while I explored downtown. Turns out the Ashland Outdoor Store is very hiker-friendly: they have a hiker box, 10% hiker discount, and a place where you can leave your pack. Plus, after I got my box, they let me sort through it there. Finally I had a burger and <i>fantastic</i>&nbsp;milkshake at Ruby's before I headed out. Within 1 minute of sticking my thumb out for a ride, a biker offered me a ride back to the trail (his house was a block away). He's a former JMT hiker and when we got to his house there was a family of deer in his backyard! In downtown Ashland! I started hiking after he dropped me off and saw a nice, comfy tentsite pretty soon and decided to camp there (especially since I wasn't planning on heading out until the next day anyway). Still close enough to get plenty of 3G so I spent the rest of the night watching YouTube videos and being lazy while I digested burger and milkshake.<br />\n<br />\n8/18: (22.3 miles) Being in Oregon is great. In some ways, it's still just like California (bloody hot, some snakes, fine dust everywhere), but there's one great thing about Oregon: lots of shade. Every now and then you hit an exposed section of trail where there's nothing but dead grass, rocks, dust, and <i>lots of sun</i>, but a tenth of a mile later you'll be back in the lush forest. That's what today was. In and out of the desert and forest. As I neared 7pm, I realized I might be able to make it to Hyatt Lake Resort before they closed (but I had no idea when they closed). I got to the paved road around 7:50pm and got a ride almost right away. We got to the resort at 7:55pm and...closed. Both the store and the restaurant with no one in sight. So the nice guy took me down to the Hyatt Lake Campground (where I was planning on camping anyway). The Hyatt Lake Campground is probably the nicest campground I've stayed at so far. Water from spigots, flushing toilets, plenty of outlets, and FREE SHOWERS.<br />\n<br />\n8/19: (20.4 miles) Today was pretty much the same as yesterday (desert-forest-desert-forest...repeat) but much more lush forest (which was much appreciated). Wasn't anything special that happened today...another day of hiking. Camped at South Brown Mountain Shelter with a few other hikers. It was basically a tiny log cabin with a dirt floor. There was a wide shelf that went around the inside of the cabin that I slept on with another hiker.<br />\n<br />\n8/20: (9.9 miles) Small day today. Pounded out the miles. Everything was going pretty well until I came to this section of the trail that was just fields of lava rocks. The trail was covered with \"lava rock gravel\" which isn't even close to stable and isn't what I would call \"comfortable to walk on\". And trekking poles don't help because using trekking poles on the hard, sharp rocks will destroy the tips (so I just carried the poles). I got to Highway 140 around 12:30pm and got picked up by family around 1:30pm taking me home with them to Klamath Falls. Shower! Laundry! Computer! Home-cooked food!",

    "content": "8/14: (6.6 miles hiked) I guess I shouldn't write posts about days before I actually finish hiking that day. The original plan was to hike halfway up the huge hill out of Seiad Valley, camp there, then continue the next day. Then I found out about a road that cuts off a couple miles of the PCT and <em>might</em> be a nicer grade. I started walking along that road and after about half a mile I got a hitch (just for the next mile). Then we picked up more hikers and transferred to another vehicle that took us half the road walk (about 6 miles). As soon as we got out of that truck, another truck came by and took us all the way up to the PCT! Boom! 15 difficult miles of the PCT eliminated! I camped with these other hikers I hitched with (there were surprisingly about 13 of us that all crammed into each truck).<br />\n<br />\n8/15: (22 miles) Today was lots of uphill, then downhill, then uphill, etc. And bow hunting season started today so there's plenty of trucks full of camo-clad hunters on the myriad of dirt roads we're crossing. Today was another day of pushing myself to hike to the next break after every hour (even though the desire to stop seemed to come every 40 minutes). But the best part about today- OREGON! I crossed the Oregon border just after 7pm and camped 0.4 miles afterwards near a dirt road. And as a little celebratory present, a truck was driving by and offered us ice-cold mini Gatorades! We asked them if they were going into Ashland (shot in the dark, but worth a try) and they said no. But they mentioned plenty of hunters will be heading back to I-5 tomorrow (Sunday) after the first weekend of hunting.<br />\n<br />\n8/16: (~15 miles hiked) After last night's \"good news\" of a possible ride into Ashland, we decided to break near every road we could. I was hiking with a guy named BeerBaron and a girl named Pumpkin. We would have to do 26+ miles otherwise to get to Ashland. We left camp at about 7:30am and got going. The first road we came to had a car but no people (we saw the people later but they weren't going to Ashland). Soon we came to a junction of 3 dirt roads or so. We waited there for about 20 minutes and....nothing. Then we hiked 5 miles nonstop to the next junction of roads (taking a road shortcut at one point, cutting off about a mile of the PCT). We waited here for nigh on an hour and....nothing. Well, not really \"nothing\". About 3 cars came by (all going the <em>opposite way</em>) but gave us grapes and a ginger ale! We decided to walk the road from here as it seemed about the same as the PCT but possibly less steep (and&nbsp;with the possibility of a hitch). After a couple hours there was finally a car going our way and he gave us a ride all the way into downtown Ashland! We got pizza right where he dropped us off and stayed at the Ashland Commons Hostel. Had some dinner with other hikers at the Standing Stone Brewery and it was a good time :) .",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">8/12: (23.7 miles) left early from Etna. Got a ride up to Etna summit at around 8:30am for $5. Absolutely no smoke in the air and the views were incredible! Maybe better than the Sierras'! I'll let my pictures argue that for me. Ridge-waking all day long (not my favorite) and at about 5pm I hiked over a ridge that suddenly plunged me back into the gloom of wildfire smoke, long ago burned-out forests, and insane heat &amp; humidity. Not fun. But I made it to my campsite just after dusk near an old, boarded-up ranger cabin. One of the boards over a window was gone and I was very tempted to climb in and spend the night in there but I figured the rodents probably had called dibs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8/13: (25.4 miles) new record! And today is also 3 months in! Hard to believe that I've been doing practically the same thing everyday for 3 months. Kinda bordering on existential crisis here... Nevermind. Today I got up a little late and got going around 8:45am. I decided that- to make up for it- I'll make sure to hike 3 mph all the time and limit all my breaks to 10 minutes (which means no reading). And it worked. I got to the Grider Creek Campground just before 8pm and saw the first human I had seen all day- another hiker. Nothing special at this drive-in campground: pit toilets, fire rings, and picnic tables. Not even water spigots but the creek was right nearby.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8/14: (10.8 miles) This morning I did the 6.6 mile road walk into Seiad Valley, CA. This is the last stop before Oregon! Also, Seiad Valley's Cafe is home to the famous pancake challenge: if you can eat 5 pancakes (each weighing a pound), you get them for free. Hardly anyone (hikers included) have completed it. They estimate around 25 people in the whole existence of the restaurant (only 2 in the last 7 years). I got myself 3 REGULAR-sized chocolate chip pancakes and will be heading out of here around 5pm to do the last 4.2 miles of the day (halfway up the horrible, steep hill out of Seiad Valley). Oregon, here I come!</p>\n",

    "content": "8/8: (9.7 miles) Today the other hiker (\"SupperClub\") and I checked out of our hotel, then hiked to downtown Dunsmuir for burgers. We got delicious burgers and milkshakes, then headed back the opposite way (<i>past</i>&nbsp;the Dunsmuir Lodge) to Manfredi's- a convenience store close to I-5 where we were hoping to hitch from. We did a small bit of shopping (a couple drinks and a couple snacks for the trail), then went outside to wait for someone to offer a ride (as recommended- probably not a good recommendation- by the cashier). Fortunately, someone did come to offer a ride! Even better- it was a thru-hiker with a rental car (something you don't see everyday). So we got back on trail around 12:30pm and started hiking- the wrong way (we started going down a side trail that the PCT signs were definitely pointing to, but it wasn't right). Fortunately, we caught it within about 10 minutes, backtracked, then hiked the proper way. I decided to stop and camp before the big uphill and therefore stopped pretty early (about 7pm) but still satisfied my \"half-day-out-of-town\" philosophy. SupperClub decided to tackle the 5 miles uphill that night and moved on.<br />\n<br />\n8/9: (20.6 miles) I am definitely glad that I saved the 5 miles of uphill for today. I couldn't have done that last night. Today was one of those days where there wasn't a lot of motivation to be had. Some of the songs that come into my head: \"Just keep hiking\" (the \"legs\" version to Dory's \"Just keep swimming\") and the first stanza of <a href=\"http://youtu.be/OORsz2d1H7s\" target=\"_blank\">\"Put one foot in front of the other\"</a>&nbsp;. You're bored? You're tired? That's too bad- you've got miles to cover. Fortunately there was a tiny bit of trail magic at parking lot crossing (a nearly spent water cache and what used to be oranges) to brighten the spirits. I camped at Porcupine Lake which was definitely beautiful the next morning! (See picture below)<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ciSTeWwgxng/VcpbH5j8ZMI/AAAAAAAAQIs/ckhaoQskVzg/s1600/IMG_20150810_071838487.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ciSTeWwgxng/VcpbH5j8ZMI/AAAAAAAAQIs/ckhaoQskVzg/s400/IMG_20150810_071838487.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n8/10: (24.3 miles) Today was kinda frustrating. I got going pretty early and got lots of miles in, but the PCT decided to be very uncooperative and very inefficient today. I hiked 24.3 miles today and roughly (very roughly- mostly from my coordinates and a Google search) made a progress north of 9.2 miles. I walked a ridge at one point that, instead of going north and over the ridge, it wrapped around and made a U-turn going South. At some other points, I walked for miles of trail going either directly South, South-East, or South-West. Like I said- frustrating. I need to keep reminding myself that the PCT is one of the \"National Scenic Trails\" which means it takes the <i>scenic</i>&nbsp;route (they're not called the \"National Efficient Trails\" or \"National This-Was-Planned-By-An-Engineer Trails\"). Also tonight was not a great night as my tent got attacked by a mouse (or some sort of rodent) all night. This has happened before (the night I camped at Hat Creek before Old Station a mouse/rodent chewed into my tent, ate a large chunk out of my tortillas, pooped in my tent, then left- fortunately I was just about to get more food). So now I have about 4 mouse-sized holes in the walls of my tent and for some reason the mouse/rodent liked the bottom of my sleeping bag (there was a hole chewed in the bottom of it and a handful of down was pulled out and strewn about the bottom of my tent). Let's see if REI will replace that...</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n8/11: (5.3 miles) Skip day! Today I packed up and hiked to Highway 3, then hitched (despite all doubts everywhere- it only took me about 30 minutes of hitching) to Etna. This allowed me to skip about 40 miles of trail and hopefully that'll boost me enough to get to all the places in Oregon when I want to. Hanging in Etna for the rest of the day and staying at the Alderbrook Manor's Hiker Hut. $25/night for a bed, shower, laundry, computer use, etc! Boom.</div>\n",

    "content": "8/2: (10 miles) Hiked to Burney today. Easy 3.5 miles to the road, then got a ride into town at about 11am. I stayed at the McDonald's on the WiFi till about 6pm (it wasn't very fast WiFi so things took a while). Got another ride back out and convinced them to drop me off at the Burney Falls State Park (where my box was and also about 8 miles farther down the trail). I picked up my box, sorted through food, then I was back on the trail again (aiming to go another 5 miles or so to the next campsite). Got there late and everything was uneven (not nice camping). But I made it work.<br />\n<br />\n8/3: (16.2 miles) Have you ever woken up in the morning and been frustrated that the dream you just had isn't what your life is like? That was this morning. So the rest of the day I kinda just lazily hiked, taking breaks whenever I felt like it. Lots of reading. I camped about 7 miles earlier than I would've on a better day (7 miles being the next water source). But on the up-side I got to camp early (before 8) and took my time making dinner and such. On an interesting side-note: I camped next to another random hiker, but that hiker was the first human I had seen in 24 hours (which may be the longest in my life).<br />\n<br />\n8/4: (17.9 miles) Another semi-lazy day. Today I mostly just got bored. There was a lot of \"ridge walking\" later in the day and as beautiful as the scenery is, it gets a little tiresome. Not much else to say about today. Just another PCT day.<br />\n<br />\n8/5: (23.5 miles) Alright, time to make up for that laziness. I got up \"early\" (early for me) at 7 and got going by 8:30. Just a little bit of walking put me on the downhill for most of the day. This downhill was in the thick of a forest with lots of undergrowth and lots of forest! It was a nice, cool, fast-paced hike down the hill to lunch. I stopped and had lunch at Ash Camp next to the McCloud River, then booked it up the steep climb out of here. Made it up the hill and to camp just before 8! Boom. [Also, today was the day that I really started noticing smoke from the wildfires. It's <i>everywhere</i>. I first thought it was fog or that I was hiking through a cloud but it was too thin to be either of that. You'll see this in some of my most recent pictures]<br />\n<br />\n8/6: (19.8 miles) Got up early again to tackle the day. Last night some hikers got in late to my campsite (~11pm) and were talking loudly most of the night, then left early (and loudly) at ~5am so my sleep didn't go as well as planned. A bit of downhill today to water (last water for the next 10 miles) then lots of uphill. Last big uphill before Castella! Hiked up the uphill as quickly as possible and made it about 1/3 down the other side by 1:30pm (when I usually have lunch). Instead of having lunch, I decided to wolf down the rest of my snacks and try to bust it to Castella for a good meal (I was 7 miles away). I made it to the road to Castella at 4:15pm and got a ride in 45 minutes later. Unfortunately \"Castella\" turned out to not be much more than a gas station and convenience store. So I bought some snacks and a deli sandwich before camping at the Castle Crags campground nearby.<br />\n<br />\n8/7: (ZERO) Today I'll be taking a zero. I would prefer not taking an <i>entire</i>&nbsp;day off, but another hiker offered to split a hotel room with me (and he's a little bit slower) so that's what we're doing tonight. Plus I usually stay overnight anytime I stop at town to get a box, but I haven't stopped overnight in a town (or showered, slept in a bed, or done laundry) since Chester (9 days ago). So that's what I'll be doing today.",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">\n7/29: (19 miles) This morning I hung around Chester some more. Had some cereal for breakfast at the trail angel's house, then went to the famous Pine Shack Frosty for a milkshake, then Burger Depot for lunch. Got back on trail about 12:30 and IT WAS HOT! Slow progress the rest of the day but made it all the way to the drive-in campground for the night.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n7/30: (19.4 miles) Started out the day in the best way: hiking about 0.5 miles backwards to Drakesbad Guest Ranch for breakfast. Buffet style with French Toast &amp; continental everything else! Delicious! Sat on their measly Wi-Fi for too long (couple hours) then started&nbsp; hiking at about 11. At this point it was WAY too hot and I stopped for breaks often. Was still so full from breakfast that I skipped lunch. It was a boring, flat hike out of Lassen Park and I set up camp next to the \"famous\" (in reference to <i>Wild</i>) Hat Creek. Gonna get to Old Station in the morning!</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n7/31: (15.3 miles) Low day, but a high day considering that I'm doing it out of a town. Hung around in Old Station for a while. First stayed around the post office waiting for a box till 1:30 (my food was already there, but I had bought new socks and they had yet to arrive). Once I got the socks I headed down the street to another small store/resort that let me use their Wi-Fi. I stayed there chatting to the owner and using the Wi-Fi for about 5 hours. Then headed out and met some other hikers at JJ's restaurant for dinner. I got a burger (a really good one, but still not extraordinary) and all of us split the cost of a tray of cinnamon rolls! The girl who was waiting our table was astonished with how fast I ate mine. Then I headed out and night-hiked the remaining 8 miles or so till the campsite.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n8/1: (22.1 miles) the miles of today were done not because I'm being ambitious but out of necessity. 0.7 miles from last night's campsite is a canyon where you can hike down a steep and treacherous 0.5 mile trail to a water source. Not ideal at all, but it's the last water source for 21 miles. So I did it. Fortunately some trail angels have placed a cache 8 miles into that stretch so I only carried about 3 liters. Had lunch at the amazing cache (not just water- there were chairs, a trail register, and it was all enclosed in an arrangement of sticks making it look like a large beaver dam). Cameled-up and hiked the next section. There was a cache next to a paved road about 8 miles later and it was also awesome (perfect timing too- I had about 1 liter left and was getting worried). Saw an amazing sunset and pushed on into dusk before I set up camp. Burney tomorrow!</div>\n",

    "content": "I passed the halfway point today! It's crazy to think that finally there are fewer miles in front of me than behind me! I'm now closer to Canada (along the PCT) than I am to Mexico. This means that I've spent about 2.5 months hiking (precisely 77 days) about 1325 miles (tonight I'm at PCT mile 1335.4).<br />\n<br />A little intro to this blog if you're just jumping in now: I post to my blog every night with the GPS coordinates of where I'm camping. I also do a couple posts when I get to a town with a summary of each day (since the last town) and sometimes some random posts (like interesting creatures I've seen). And feel free to comment on posts! If you ask a question in the comments, I always try to respond and answer your question.<br /><br />If you're looking to catch up on my blog, here you can see just the posts where I summarize each day thus far: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/FbGLmj\">goo.gl/FbGLmj</a> .

    "title": "Woah, what happened?",
    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">[Ok, if you're following my GPS posts, you may be like \"dude, you're hiking so fast!\" and I'm like \"Yeah, I'm hiking so fast I smell burning rubber!\". But really....no. That's absurd. I'm trying to get to home (Bend, Oregon) by my birthday (September 2nd) because <u>I can</u>. It's in the realm of possibility and- because I'm hiking for the experience and not for the purity of the hike- I'm going for it. I jumped from Gold Lake Lodge to Buck's Lake and I will be jumping from Highway 3 to Etna later. This should put me on track. Now, back to our \"regularly scheduled\" (pssh) summaries post...]</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/25: (2.5 miles) Woah, big day! Just kidding. I spent the morning hanging out at Gold Lake Lodge. I stayed there \"taking care of things\" (they had WiFi and it was a decent speed...just not reliable at all) until about noon. Once I got frustrated with the WiFi and decided I had used it to its full extent, I made a sign that said \"PCT Hiker to Quincy\" out of the box that I received my next shipment of food in. I stood next to the Gold Lake Highway (not a very busy highway at all) and waited. After about half an hour (and about 3 cars going my way) one pulled over and gave me a ride to Graeagle (the next closest town). I went into the tiny store, bought an ice cream, Cock n Bull ginger beer (booyah!) and lunch: a banana and king-size Snickers. Then started hitching outside the store with the same sign and after about 45 minutes (and <i>way</i>&#160;more cars- but none stopped) the guy that gave me a ride was the Graeagle pastor going to see his in-laws in Quincy! They insisted I stay for dinner so I got steak, salad, bread, and more ice cream! Then I decided if I'm going to get to Ashland by the 18th (and Bend by my birthday- see bracketed statement above), I should take advantage of the opportunity (the in-laws house was about halfway between the Buck's Lake and Quincy access points). So I had him take me up there and I did about 2.5 miles of hiking before it got dark (and skipped about 52 miles today).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/26: (16.3 miles) Lower day, but in to Belden! Lots and LOTS of downhill. Seriously, if you have the capability, look up the PCT descent into Belden (northbound). The elevation vs. PCT mile graph looks like it dropped off a cliff. Belden is a tiny, <i>tiny</i>&#160;town in a canyon. The hike to the canyon was beautiful and full of lush forest but the hike down alternated between forest and exposed desert. Belden's main building is the Belden Resort and I got a soda at their tiny convenience store. I was expecting to stay with the Braatens trail angels that call their place \"Little Haven\" but they have closed early this year. They have closed early because some [pardon the crude, but very appropriate, expression] asshole hikers were rude and not grateful (I heard a rumor that one hiker got drunk and started yelling at Mrs. Braaten in the middle of the night). So they brought me the box I had sent to their house but I had to find somewhere else to stay. A biker (as in motorcycle) couple saw me sitting outside the Resort and invited me and another hiker couple to camp with them. So we got \"vortexed\". They bought us beer (I got a 2-liter of root beer), made us pork chops, veggies, and salad. It was marvelous. A little later some other hikers joined the party and marijuana and mushrooms were passed around. That's when I went to bed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/27: (21.3 miles) Alright, the plan: get to Chester (46 miles away) by tomorrow night. Why? Well, there's a place with really good milkshakes but the main reason is that I didn't get to stay in a real bed in Belden so I want to do that (also I forgot to charge my external battery pack so that needs to be done). I was trying to do 26 miles today, but 26 miles up the other side of the canyon (not as steep but still daunting) was not happening. I finally made it up there and was exhausted. So I hiked a bit farther and compromised for just doing over 20 miles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/28: (25.1 miles) Well, because yesterday didn't go according to plan, that means that today I have to make up the difference. 25.1 miles! A new record! I hiked as quickly as I could but it was agonizing up the hot exposed ridges (here it's more like the desert again). I only made it 8.9 miles before lunch at 1:30pm. Shameful. But I powered up the hill to get to the halfway marker (FREAKIN' HALFWAY TO CANADA!), then it was all downhill from there (which means 3.2+ mph). I barely made it to the highway before dark but there was a trail angel dropping off hikers 5 minutes after I got there and I'm staying in the RV that they have parked in front of their house. These people are awesome! Milkshake tomorrow, then back on the trail.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">7/21: (7.3 miles) This morning I hung around town a bit before heading out. And I had some family come up to meet me in Truckee who insisted on treating me to lunch (we went to Jax at the Tracks and it was delicious). They brought my box from Soda Springs and I did my food planning and sorting at the trail angel's house. As we were on our way back to the trail angel's house, the heavens opened up and all hail broke loose (it hailed like crazy- like a couple inches deep of hail everywhere). So I decided to hang out a little bit longer in Truckee. The trail angel mentioned there's a back country ski hut on the PCT and I decided to get there and stay there. The Peter Grubb hut was amazing!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/22: (22.9 miles) At the Peter Grubb hut there were also some equestrian riders doing a short trip. Because they had pack mules and everything with them they don't have to worry about weight and they can bring lots of luxuries. They fed me breakfast! Hashbrowns and sausage! So without having to make my own breakfast, I got going early (about 8:15). Today had some significant breaks in it, but I kept up 3 mph basically all day so I was able to make up for it. Got to a paved road near a couple campgrounds at the end of the day. I walked down, picked the nearest open one, and set up my tent there. Camping in luxury!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/23: (15 miles) Left the campground and did a couple small hills like no one's business. But then it started to get hot. Lots of downhill took me to the highway into Sierra City around lunch time. I didn't have a box there so I decided if I got a hitch in 15 minutes or less I would stay a couple hours, get food, then hike on. It took me 5 minutes to get a hitch! I met some hiker friends I hadn't seen in forever, got a good burger, and sat on the \"January's molasses\" Wi-Fi for about 3 hours catching up on email and downloading some videos. Hitched out and hiked up the big steep hill ahead. All the switchbacks!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7/24: (12.3 miles) Started off the day with lots of rocky terrain. Worst kind of trail ever. Was also out of water and really thirsty for the day's first 5 miles or so. But I was mostly able to keep up a good pace till lunchtime. Then about 1.2 miles and I took the 3-mile side trail to Gold Lake Lodge and my box (for some reason I was an idiot when planning and sent a box here instead of Sierra City). But it all worked out because they gave me a tent to stay in for free (what you would bring on a car camping trip) with a couple mattresses from the cabins- I just paid for whatever food I ordered in the restaurant (which was delicious). Wi-Fi here isn't great, but it's working. Might hitch up to Quincy, CA and skip about 20 miles (I'm trying to get to Oregon by about the 18th or so of August so I can get to home for my birthday on 9/2. So I might be doing a bit of hopping here and there).</p>\n",

    "content": "7/18: (20.3 miles) Got up early this morning because my little cousin had a swim meet. She's 4 years old and she does 3-4 25 yard races every Saturday! When I was 4, I'm pretty sure I'd just be content sitting around on my butt all day. So most of the family got dropped off at the swim meet, then I got dropped off at the trail. I started about 8 am (at least an hour earlier than I usually start), but I got a full day of hiking in! Went over the very pitiful Dick's Pass (pitiful because it's only at about 9000 feet). Wanted to do a couple more miles but the motivation wasn't having it.<br />\n<br />\n7/19: (23.3 miles) Now that's what I'm talking about! Today was a little rough going in the morning, but I was able to convince myself to not stop for lunch until I got to the parking lot with the picnic tables (the trail crosses through it). That was about 12 miles in and I made it there about 3 pm. After lunch it started drizzling but I was much happier because up the hill immediately after lunch I had cell phone service and data! Not like it matters a whole lot- I was just at a town the day before- but it's nice to have. Lots of hiking along the mountain ridges and entered a skiing area (the trail weaves right along the top edge of the ski boundary). Hiked a couple miles downhill and got to my campsite just as it was getting dark.<br />\n<br />\n7/20: (17.5 miles) Hiking up the next hill was not fun today. It took FOREVER. It wasn't the most horrible hill I've been on, but all morning the motivation wasn't feeling it, I had the #1 distraction in the form of 3G, and the combination killed my pace. But I eventually made it up there. Down in the valley before the next big hill I took my lunch break. Had about 10 miles to go, but I took my time eating. Was able to convince myself to get up the next hill (about the same in steepness and height as the first one) without stopping! Right at the top there was a sign that said \"Truckee\" and I thought \"Perfect! That's where I'm headed, so this must be the way\". About 0.2 miles later down the steep, gravel-y hill I came to 2 trails and a road. After a bit of confusion, I realized that the \"Truckee\" sign wasn't where I was supposed to go at all but apparently this trail still leads into Truckee (it's called the Coldstream trail). So I said \"Screw it\" and followed the dirt road. I followed it FOREVER downhill until it finally turned into a paved road, then connected to a busy road where, after about 30 minutes, I was able to hitch a ride into Truckee. Got dinner at the Circle K and stayed the night at a trail angel's house.",

    "content": "<i>Wow, it's been awhile. I was hoping to have internet access at North Kennedy Meadows, but that wasn't happening. I could've written up a summaries post up to there, then just published it when I got service yesterday (7/15), but I felt lazy. A physical, full-size keyboard is one of the luxuries I try to indulge in when I get into a town.</i><br />\n<br />\n7/6: (ZERO) Today was an unintended zero day. I spent most of the morning doing what I usually do in town: go to the library to use the computer, do some shopping to mess around with my food stash a little (and to buy a couple \"indulgence items\" like soda), etc. Mammoth Lakes is great! In the summer they have free shuttles that run you all around to basically within a block or two of anywhere you need to go. Around noon I found out that there is a bus that goes from Mammoth Lakes to Tuolumne Meadows (exactly where I want to go!) for $9 one-way. One problem- it only runs in the morning (and I just missed the last one). So I figured I'll hitch hike out later. Just as I'm finishing up hanging around town (around 4pm) and decide I'll go back to the hostel, grab my stuff, then hitch out the skies darken and rain starts a-pourin'. So I stayed at the hostel another night...<br />\n<i></i><br />\n7/7: (14.2 miles) This morning I woke up early and took the first bus out to Tuolumne Meadows (6 am bus). It was just me and one other PCT hiker the whole ~2hr ride! [As I mentioned in my last summary, I'm jumping ahead to Tuolumne because I went into Mammoth for fun- thereby royally stabbing my schedule in the gut- so originally the jump ahead was supposed to allow me to enjoy Mammoth <i>and</i> also get me back a little closer to my original schedule. But because of yesterday's unintended zero, I'm still the same behind schedule as I was before (but I still got to enjoy Mammoth)]. I had to wait at the post office because the tiny, little window that is the post office doesn't give out hiker boxes until 10 am. No, they open at 9 am, but they refuse to give out hiker boxes anytime except 10 to 4 (<u>on the hour only</u>). So I got a box from Amazon.com that I had ordered back in Independence (<u>real</u> sun gloves, some notebooks so I can write my thoughts on something other than the back of maps, and a <u>large</u> external battery pack- so I can charge my phone as often as I want, even on 6-day stretches). Punched out 14.2 miles from the Post Office (which I think is pretty good for an \"afternoon-only\" hike).<br />\n<br />\n7/8: (16.4 miles) Yeah, a smaller day. But because of where I camped last night, if I wanted to add another 4 miles or so, I'd have to make some significant progress up the next pass (which is horrendous to do steep uphills late in the day). So I camped at the bottom of the valley and saved it for the next day). Nothing particularly exciting about today. Just lots of hiking (with the classic \"up the hill, down the hill, up the hill, down the hill,......\" of the Sierras).<br />\n<br />\n7/9: (16.6 miles) Ok, different day, a different excuse. Today's excuse: IT RAINED ALL FREAKING DAY. If you haven't seen the \"dramatization\" (quotes because it wasn't really a dramatization- that's what it was like), then I'll link it right <a href=\"http://dantesupertramp.blogspot.com/2015/07/say-there-mr-pct-hiker-what-it-like.html\">here</a>. Now it didn't rain <u>all day</u>. But it was drizzling when I woke up and packed up my stuff, poured until about 11am (where I was thankful to get a brief intermission to eat lunch in the sun), then it started raining again about 2pm, and poured through the night (yes, I had to set up my tent in the pouring down rain. I'll let that post explain the rest of today. [I promise, I <i>really</i> did intend to do 20+ miles today but the rain destroyed my hopes and dreams]<br />\n<br />\n7/10: (18.1 miles) A bigger day, but still not as much as I hoped. This morning it was still raining so I decided to stay in my tent for another 30 minutes (and I would pack up and leave no matter what). At 10 am (just about at the end of the 30 min) it stopped raining and I quickly packed up my stuff and took off. Pretty chill hiking today and not anything particularly special. It was overcast almost all day with a little bit of rain here and there. Today I stopped for two reasons combined. At the end of the day I had a big hill climb but was intending to push through and camp on top of the hill. The reason I stopped early was because a big storm cloud was rolling in and we all know how much I <i>love</i> hiking in the rain. So I hiked about 1/3 of the way up the hill and camped there.<br />\n<br />\n7/11: (10.6 miles) Finished hiking over that hill (and as Beck might say- it was a bugger!). This morning was nice and sunny, but as soon as I got over that hill, I immediately regretted sending my thick gloves back home at Tuolumne Meadows. It was freezing wind for most of the morning and at high altitude (above 10,400 feet for the rest of the day). Finally, around noon I saw the highway down below and booked it down the hill into Sonora Pass. After about 45 minutes I hitched a ride with a couple other hikers into North Kennedy Meadows (not to be confused with Kennedy Meadows at the start of the Sierras). As I got there, I realized that there was no internet and little cell phone service (not what I was hoping for...). I <i>did</i> have access to roaming data, but my provider (while it is nice and cheap for unlimited everything: Republic Wireless) doesn't have unlimited roaming data (only 25 MB a month!). So needless to say, I didn't have internet access. I wanted to grab my box, then hitch a ride in the opposite direction (across the PCT and going the other way) to Bridgeport, but when I saw that N Kennedy Meadows had a bed, shower, and laundry for $35, I stayed. Instead I just texted my dad, mom, and others for the rest of the afternoon and evening- having them look up things for me (thank you!). I had dinner at the restaurant there which wasn't the most high quality but was very filling! Salmon (because the burgers looked like crap) which came with a baked potato, corn on the cob, soup, salad, a roll, and I also got ordered the bottomless root beer! Slept well tonight! [Also I was able to ditch my stupid extra required 2 lbs that is the bear canister. It's not required from here on out so good riddance!]<br />\n<br />\n7/12: (14 miles) Woke up this morning and immediately went downstairs to check out the breakfast menu. $5.95 for pancakes? And then tax? I can do better than that. So my breakfast was a Clif Builder's Bar, a sleeve of mini powdered doughnuts, and a Hostess Apple Pie from the store for about $4.50 total. Boom. After finally organizing all my new food and supplies, I checked out at 11am (check out times are way too early). I decided to sit outside and munch on some lunch (a roast beef sandwich from the store's fridge) for an hour before I tried to find a ride. About halfway through my sandwich, a guy starts talking to me about the PCT and offers me a ride back up to Sonora Pass! So much better than a hitch! When I get back to the trailhead, there's a trail angel in his camper giving out hotdogs, beans, cookies, and sodas! Unfortunately, I just ate lunch....but I'm never out of room for soda and a cookie! Hiked up the big hill immediately out of the trailhead, then a big downhill on the other side.<br />\n<br />\n7/13: (20.1 miles) Finally got some decent miles in again! I'm meeting family at Echo Lake that will take me home to Sacramento and I'll spend a zero day there (the main reason I wanted data earlier because I prefer email). Because I'm meeting them on the 16th, the only reason to do 20 miles today is to make the next two days easier. Today is a pretty easy day. One big hill (and it's not even really that steep). Not too much special about today....except that today marks two months in! See my post about that <a href=\"http://dantesupertramp.blogspot.com/2015/07/two-months-in.html\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n7/14: (16.3 miles) Yeah, a nice easy day. Woke up and took my time getting going. It was also really nice to be able to just sit and read on my Kindle because I <i>could</i> and not because I felt I <i>had to</i> in order to keep my motivation up. I still hiked fast (trying to keep my pace high) but I took lots of breaks to read.<br />\n<br />\n7/15: (15.4 miles) Did a little more than I needed to yesterday, so I was able to do even a little less today. My day started off with finishing off the uphill I started yesterday evening. Once I got to the top, there was a \"hiker party\" (about 6 other hikers that had gotten to the top of the hill and decided to take a rest/break). So I hung out for a bit, then left early. They hiked fast and caught up to me! We were just sitting down for lunch later at a lake (Frog Lake) and about 1.5 miles down the hill was a highway and information center. We figured we'd eat lunch at the lake, then check out the information center and see if they had a vending machine or something. We were about 10 minutes into lunch when another hiker (who was behind us) runs to the lake and says, \"Guys, a volunteer on the trail just told me that down at the information center there's pineapple, fruit, cookies, and hotdogs!\" Needless to say, we packed up our stuff as fast as we could and booked it down there. I hiked probably about 4 mph and passed all the day hikers \"Excuse me! Pardon me! Coming through!\". We got there and there was the best on-trail (as opposed to town) trail magic I have ever seen! (See picture below). I ate two hotdogs, a Twinkie, a bag of Doritos, a bag of Cracker Jacks, a banana, an apple, two sodas, and two freshly-made cookies (they were burnt but still delicious). So the big reading breaks of yesterday turned into me taking one big break (2+ hrs) of just sitting at the information center at Carson Pass eating free food! Also, about 1.75 miles later I got full 3G and service on my phone! So that's where I posted the \"Two months\" and \"Hiking in the Rain\" posts from. I took an hour break there and read all the emails I had missed and such.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mthU4om.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ncpx9ekaUog/Vagxzc781WI/AAAAAAAAPW8/p5u1Zs8ttEY/s320/IMG_20150715_142723959.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n7/16: (10.3 miles) Echo Lake! Family! Sacramento (really Penryn, but close enough)! I left at 8 am this morning (pretty early considering I usually leave around 9:15 or later). I hiked the easy stuff from Showers Lake where I camped, then right before the big downhill into Echo Lake I got full phone service again! (This delayed me for only about 20 minutes this time because last time I was able to read emails- the big thing- but the service kept going in and out. This time I had full enough service to check other things such as Snapchat). I hiked down the hill quickly (again, around 3.5 mph or more) and got to Highway 50 around noon. The Highway 50 crossing is dangerous! Crossing 3 lanes of traffic that's moving quite quickly is dangerous. I booked it as fast as I could and still felt like I barely made it between that gap of cars. The last uphill push then I was at Echo Lake. Got my box from the tiny Post Office window and found out there was another hiker going into Sacramento with friends (earlier than my family was going to give me a ride). So I got a ride with him all the way to my family for free! Now hanging out here at my family's house and using a physical keyboard to write these posts! Haven't seen this family in about 3 years and it's nice to see them again (but weird to approach their house from the South instead of the North from Oregon like usual).<br />\n<br />\n7/17: (ZERO) An on-purpose zero day! Preparing my new boots (only 2nd pair!) and relaxing! Not sure what else I'll do, but I'm sure that I'll be able to satiate any longings or \"to-do list\" items that have been accumulating on trail.",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">July 13th! Two months in! I've crossed the 1000 mile mark and will cross the 40% (1060 miles) mark tomorrow (because I have to finish on October 13th- exactly 5 months from when I started- I'm pretty close to the absolute \"slowest\" I can be traveling). I'm a little over 100 miles behind my original schedule that had me finishing on the 1st of October, but I'm not that worried. If I need to, I'll be jumping from my parent's house in Bend to Government Camp (or even Timberline) which will boost me forward at least 100 miles. At this point I'm more into the \"experience\" of the PCT than the purity of it (taking a zero here and there with family or for a holiday). I'm making little hops here and there but my main rule still holds: except for the Government Camp/Timberline jump, I'll never jump from one resupply to the next (always less than that).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(This 1000 mile mark almost makes me feel entitled. Like I could go into a restaurant and say, \"I have hiked over one thousand miles to get here, can I get a discount?\" It's also a lot of fun to be able to say \"thousand\" in the answer to all the \"how far have you come?\" questions)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Motivation: more often now I run into days where I am not very motivated. Almost every day I'm getting up at 7:30 or 8 and not starting to hike till 9 or 9:30. But my mood usually turns up around lunchtime when I take an hour or so to relax, eat, and read. Then I can usually pound out enough miles post-lunch to still make at least 20 for the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately the PCT has lost its initial thrill of adventure- but I guess that eventually happens with everything. Now I look forward to going into a resupply and taking a break from the trail (course it's not like I didn't before) and I get that boost of motivation after just leaving a \"town\".</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost to halfway!

    "title": "Say there, Mr. PCT hiker, what&#39;s it like hiking in the rain?",
    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It sucks. It freaking sucks. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[This post was written on 7/9 after hiking for nearly 12 straight hours in the rain. I woke up to the rain, packed up my stuff in the rain, hiked in the rain, and set up camp in the rain. Every part of me is cold, wet, tired, and hungry- actually that part is just my stomach.]</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Explain yourself\" you say? Very well. Go put on all your hiking gear. Go ahead, I'll wait. Yeah, rain gear too (like it will matter). Finished? Now have your friends dump buckets of water on you until you almost- almost but not quite- feel like you went swimming in a lake in all those clothes. Have them dump a bucket or two on your backpack too for good measure. Don't worry. All the important stuff like food, sleeping bag, and electronics are in waterproof containers. OK, now we're going for a hike. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You know that section of the PCT that you're currently hiking? Yeah the one where the elevation vs mileage graph looks like a readout from a heart rate monitor? You still have to hike that. But now it's raining. So about 90% of any section of trail that's flat is now a long puddle a couple inches deep and any up/down sections are now flowing rivers. A couple inches? That's not too bad! Oh wait, you're a PCT hiker. You're likely wearing trail running shoes or boots where the only waterproof part is the rubber sole. \"So I'll just walk on the side of the trail and avoid all the puddles.\" Alright, go ahead. But over there is what we call \"hikerwash\" (very, very wet plants). It's almost just as bad as stepping in the puddles. And although you <i>are</i> in a forest, the trees aren't providing any significant shelter. No dry spot, no matter how well- sheltered, can maintain its sense of dryness in rain of this duration. Eventually, rain conquers all.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So after about 12 hours of this, you've learned that really the best word to associate with the rain is not \"growth\" as your kindergarten teacher, mom, Sunday school teacher, or whatever \"positive Paula\" may have taught you. The best word for the rain is \"misery\".</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So now it's time to set up camp. You were hoping the rain would stop by now, but- Oh wait!- no, it hasn't. It's still pouring down buckets of misery on you. You look for a campsite and your choices are:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A) no shelter from rain<br>\nB) no shelter from rain<br>\nC) little shelter from rain!..... Crap, my tent won't fit<br>\nD) no shelter from rain</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's go with B. As soon as you get out your tent it sounds like the drum line in a marching band. You set it up as quickly as possible yet setting it up requires you to temporarily expose the mesh netting to the elements. In the end, your tent is set up but with a couple puddles inside. You curse the world, shove your stuff inside, and sit down in one of the puddles. And as liquid misery shakes your tent all night long you pray that the thin membrane above your head doesn't have a leak somewhere or the morning will be much worse. You twist and contort your body in weird positions all night long to keep the sleeping bag away from the condensated walls of your tent but with little success. Good night!</p>\n",

But with my Kindle, I've gained that back on the PCT. When the famous (or, maybe to PCT hikers- infamous) Cheryl Strayed of <i>Wild</i>&nbsp;hiked part of the PCT, she read quite a few books and there are some book clubs that adopt her reading list as their own (you can see it here: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/m8uZs1\">goo.gl/m8uZs1</a>). So I thought I'd share the books I've been reading so far (I'm not really putting summaries on this list cause you can look those up anywhere.

    "content": "7/3: (0 PCT miles, but ~6 miles hiked) Hung out at VVR for most of the day. Had breakfast &amp; lunch, used internet, and got some time to recollect my bearings before heading out again. Total cost at VVR: ~$78! $16 for 2 hrs of internet (they have satellite internet) and probably about $35 for food (breakfast and lunch). It was really good food but also really expensive food. The rest of the money was spent on random little things at the store. Around lunch time I met 4 other hikers (3 JMT southbounders and 1 PCT section-hiker southbound). We all had lunch together and had a fun time hanging out. Plus, we all split the cost of a whole apple pie a la mode! It was delicious! Headed out about 5:30pm (should've headed out earlier) and just made it back to the PCT before I decided to camp (didn't want to try approaching the next pass at night).<br />\n<br />\n7/4: (17 miles) Meant to do more today, but it didn't quite happen. As usual- going over the daily pass killed the mood. Had lunch just before Silver Pass and just as I left to start up the pass, it started raining. Classic Sierras. Once I got over the pass and started going down the other side the heavens opened up and unleashed their wrath upon me- thunder, lightning, lots of rain, and- for the first time this trip- hail. This was the first time I actually pulled out my umbrella (first time used as a rain umbrella and not a reflective sun umbrella) and decided to wait out the rain. I stood under a tree with my backpack by my feet and my umbrella over my head for about half an hour before I decided it was safe enough to move on. Once again, JMT hikers are amusing. Shortly after my \"rain break\" I saw about 10 tents set up. This must be what goes through their heads: \"Oh, it's raining? About 1pm? Better set up here and try again tomorrow!\". I hiked up and down a couple small hills for the rest of the day before stopping at Duck Lake to camp. Camped with a Portland, OR couple that's also doing the PCT! They were awesome ('course who from Portland isn't awesome?)! Had a lot of fun sharing laughs with them before heading out the next day.<br />\n<br />\n7/5: (11.3 miles) Hiked to Red's Meadow Resort just about 0.3 miles off the PCT. It's a hub for trailheads around the area (majorly Devil's Postpile and Rainbow Falls) and has a general store and cafe. I pushed out the miles to get there (again probably hitting around 3.5 mph!). On the way down the hill I got service during one of my breaks and got a little distracted...but made it to Red's Meadow at about 1:30pm and immediately went to the cafe and got a cheeseburger (~$10 for the lamest cheeseburger in the world. Disappointing.). But the general store had free WiFi (and pretty fast WiFi!) so I uploaded all the photos and such I wasn't able to do at VVR. Hung out there for a while and decided to go into Mammoth Lakes (there's a bus that runs from Red's Meadow to Mammoth Lakes for $7). Right before the bus I saw Beck! She has been busting out the miles! She [somehow] did 25 miles that day from about 7am to 5pm! So we rode the bus into Mammoth together and caught up. I stayed at the Davison St. Guest House for $35 with a few other PCT hikers. Mammoth's downtown was having a 4th of July celebration complete with a band, drama/stilts/skit/thing, and fireworks so I enjoyed that. Along with the dessert crepe I got at a restaurant nearby afterwards <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/541/\">:) .</a> Because I didn't have a real reason to go to Mammoth (I didn't have a box there or anything, just taking a holiday for the holiday) and am therefore royally screwing with my schedule, I'm going to be jumping up to my next box at Tuolumne Meadows.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o90i9AE7S9w/VZrUAvlWd7I/AAAAAAAAPQo/7kY13Am9B5Q/s1600/IMG_20150705_210449067.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o90i9AE7S9w/VZrUAvlWd7I/AAAAAAAAPQo/7kY13Am9B5Q/s320/IMG_20150705_210449067.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n<br />",

    "title": "A Comment and an Observation",
    "content": "Observation: for a while now (maybe a week) the JMT and the PCT have been the same trail. And because most JMT hikers are southbound, I see a lot more of them than I do PCT hikers. My observation: JMT hikers are <i>weird</i>. The trail is only 211 miles which should take.... maybe 11 or 12 days to do (if you put in pretty good mileage). But I've seen tents set up as late as 10:30am and set up as early as 5:15pm. I very rarely see anyone on the trail after 7pm. It's like they're lazy and just take their time (a huge contrast to my journey where I push as many miles as I can everyday). Also- all of their packs look super huge! One guy told me his pack was over 50 lbs! Even with 5 days of food, mine is only about 45 or less.<div>\n<br /></div>\n<div>\nComment: I have a love-hate relationship with the Sierras. They are easily some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen and sometimes I think I might as well be in Oregon (lush forest, plenty of large streams and rivers, lots of undergrowth, nice grassy meadows, etc). But the terrain is HORRIBLE. Everyday is up and over another pass (1000s of feet in elevation gain) then down into a valley (1000s of feet in elevation loss). Also, imagine that you are walking up and down stairs, but these stairs aren't any normal stairs. They're about 1.5-2 feet high (sometimes higher) and about 5 feet long. And they're not just flat on top- imagine every \"stair\" is filled with golfball-size gravel. Yeah. Not fun on the ankles. And you have to go up and down these near the top of every pass. And this coupled with the thunderstorms everyday is why I'm hating the Sierras.</div>\n",

    "content": "<i>Quite a few of these summaries will be short as it has been a long time since I have been able to post. Also, here at Vermillion Valley Resort, their internet access is satellite so they charge hikers $8/hr. Ouch!</i><br />\n<br />\n6/24: (~4 miles) Leaving Lone Pine. I was hoping to leave around 4pm for the trail, but it didn't happen until around 7pm. And, in the Sierras, all town access requires you to walk a side trail to the edge of the Sierras (where there is likely a campground and parking lot), then hitch the 20 or so miles off the Sierras and down into town. It's a pain in the butt. So this night I didn't get a lot of hiking done plus I had to pay $40 to a guy that does these trips up the hill (he'd do it for free but it's not exactly cheap on gas to drive all the way from the valley up into the Sierras). Hiked the ~4 miles uphill back to the PCT, then stopped and camped at the Lake.<br />\n<br />\n6/25: (19.4 miles) Hiked past Mt. Whitney today. Didn't exactly see it (or at least wasn't sure which one it was), but oh well. Also, today the JMT (John Muir Trail- goes from Yosemite to Mt. Whitney and coincides with the PCT) joined the PCT today (or maybe the PCT joined the JMT?) so from now on I'll see a lot of southbound JMT hikers (most people hike southbound to Mt. Whitney). Not much else to say about today. Just a lot of hiking.<br />\n<br />\n6/26: (~22.5 miles) Today was a big uphill! In fact, the biggest uphill on the whole PCT! Forester Pass is at 13,790 ft elevation and is the highest point on the PCT. (You know, I've been offered weed quite a few times already- declined every time- and this is still the highest I have ever been on the PCT). The pass itself wasn't too bad (the hike <u>to</u>&nbsp;the pass was the worst part) but the scenery on the other side was beautiful! Plenty of lush forest next to the river (which brings with it- many mosquitoes). I hiked down into the valley, then up to Kearsarge Pass. Kearsarge Pass is a 7.6 mile side trail that goes from the PCT to the Onion Valley campground (access to Independence). I hiked late to get over the pass and camped on the end of one of the switchbacks on the way down (still about 3.6 miles from the parking lot).<br />\n<br />\n6/27: (0 PCT miles, but 3.6 miles) I hiked the rest of the Kearsarge Pass trail quickly this morning! As fast as I could! I passed a lot of weekenders on the way down and was fortunate to get a ride down the mountains in about 30 minutes. They dropped me off at the post office and fortunately there was someone working in the back (I'm willing to dub him a \"trail angel\") who was able to give me my box even though they aren't open on Saturdays. I chilled at the Subway (basically the only restaurant in town) and sat on the WiFi for a couple hours. Got a footlong and headed over to the hotel about noon. I stayed at the Couthouse Motel in their hiker bunkhouse for $25 (and no one else was in the bunkhouse so I had it all to myself!). Got a shower and lounged there for the rest of the day.<br />\n<br />\n6/28: (13.3 miles) Hung out for a bit in the bunkhouse and hitched from the Post Office around noon. Fortunately there was a guy going up to check out the campground and gave me a ride up for free! And I only had to wait about 10 min! Left the campground about noon and hiked over two passes pretty quickly (Kearsarge and Glen). Got down to the Rae Lakes area and it was beautiful! For a while the PCT literally strolled right along the edge of the lake. I camped just past the ranger station (a nice little propane-powered cabin in the woods).<br />\n<br />\n6/29: (16.9 <strike>fl oz</strike> miles) Long, frustrating day. The rest of the downhill into the valley was nice. I passed mile 800 at the suspension bridge (why aren't there more of these on the PCT?) and then I had uphill. Uphill forever. Just the 7 miles of uphill (~4000 ft elevation gain) over Pinchot Pass was so frustrating and motivation-draining that it took me about 7 hours to do. Gross. So I got over the other side and just camped at the bottom of the next valley (basically just went until it was dark). [Fun fact: \"16.9 fl oz\" is 500 ml! Metric system is slowly taking over America! Finally!]<br />\n<br />\n6/30: (20 miles) Today's pass is Mather Pass. Not really as bad. It's pretty smooth the whole way there and even the climb over the pass isn't that steep. Easily made it over before lunch time. Once I got over the next side though, it poured. It's been sprinkling the last couple days but for about an hour we got thunder, lightning- the works. Eventually I spotted a patch of small trees and ducked inside. They didn't work super well, but they worked well enough such that I could eat lunch. The rain really did put a <u>damp</u>er on my day though (haha. puns.). Lots of downhill, slippery rocks (I fell for the 4th time on the trail), etc. I stopped quite a few times near the bottom of the valley before finally convincing myself to go the 4 more miles to make it 20 miles for the day.<br />\n<br />\n7/1: (24.5 miles) New PR! Last night I was hoping to stay in the John Muir Shelter at the top of Muir Pass, but the motivation wasn't making it happen. So this morning I made it the 7 miles and had lunch in the shelter (and it served its purpose because there was another thunderstorm today). Talked to some southbound JMT hikers in the shelter who had just come from VVR (my next resupply) and they told me all about their services, the best way to get in, etc. The new plan cut a few miles off my original plan so I decided I was going to try and push more miles today and make it there by tomorrow night. So hiked quickly down the hill (~3 mph) as fast as was reasonable and made camp late. I set up my tent about 100' off trail and hiked back to the closest water source to get water for dinner and breakfast. It was so dark (I had my headlamp, but still) that I practically wandered around for 10 minutes trying to find the trail from my tent. But on the way back I was fortunate enough to find it quickly. Tonight my tent was racked by a thunder and lightning storm directly overhead (at about 11pm and most of the night) so I spend a lot of the night awake and made a couple trips outside to re-tension stakes and guylines. My tent <i>is</i>&nbsp;waterproof, but with lots of wind the rain can get blown under the rainfly and through the netting that makes up all the walls of my tent. So my stuff got a little damp and there was a puddle inside my tent (not damaging anything- but annoying).<br />\n<br />\n7/2: (23.9 miles) Hiked over the \"pass of the day\" which was Selden pass today. Agonizing uphill with the occasional rain. Then busted it down the other side. Had the second real fording of a river today (\"real\" as in \"no stepping stones or logs\" and \"take off your socks and shoes and go wading\"). I made it to the Bear Creek trail and hit lots of hikerwash (wet plants that brush against you) from a storm that I just missed. I hiked the 7.6 miles down to the trailhead and made it in about 2 hours (about 3.8 mph!). My phone was dead but fortunately there was a nice Ukrainian family camping there for the next 4 days (through Independence day) that let me use their phone. VVR (Vermillion Valley Resort) usually send shuttles to the trailhead for $12/person but they had ended their shuttles for the day. So I helped the family move their camping stuff down to the lake for the next hour and a half (they had LOTS of stuff) and they gave me a ride down to the main road. it was about 9:30pm and I was going to hike the 3 miles down the main road when another car came by within 10 minutes or so. Super lucky! I stuck out my thumb and they gave me a ride all the way to VVR! Free camping here so I set up my tent last night.",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Wow. I haven't had internet access or cell phone service for a long time. I meant to post one of these summaries in Lake Isabella, but the trail angels that took us there were only staying for a limited time (and my phone died). So this will definitely be a longer post.</em></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/13: (3.4 miles) Yeah, today was a Nero. I spent most of the day in Tehachapi and intended to start hiking around 7pm to avoid the relentless desert sun. But I didn't get a ride to the trail until around 8:30 (just after sunset). I hiked until around 10 but stopped because I was tired (not \"exhausted tired\" but \"sleepy tried\"). As I set up my tent by headlamp one of my stakes nearly broke (I was pounding it with a rock and the stake struck a rock). The stake was still usable, but now had sharp metal edges that could cut the guy lines. Fortunately I still had some cell service and ordered two more online from REI to my next resupply.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/14: (23.2 miles) aimed to make up for yesterday's Nero and hit a PR today! Hiked the rest of the 16 miles to the water source then \"cameled-up\" for the next one (another 18 miles away). Lots of long desert hiking today and ended up hiking somewhat into the night. Not much else interesting to say about today.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/15: (15.8 miles) slow day today. Started out very sore and frustrated (the sun woke me up by heating up my tent and that's never a good start to a day. Hiked immediately up a hill with no shade but was greeted at the top by some nice forest! Up and down a couple more hills for the rest of the day and every time started down the hill as a great forest jaunt. Just before I made it to the next water source I met up with Gummy Bear and we camped at a campground that night</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/16: (22 miles) another section of up and downs today (we are starting the sierras after all) but the worst was the sun exposure. Every now and then there were patches of trees for shade but few and far inbetween. Lunch time was under a Joshua Tree that somewhat provided respite from the sun. 3 of us cowered under the tree. We jumped from water cache to water cache today (water bottles left by the trail courtesy of trail angels) with no guarantee that they would be stocked. But they fortunately were. Walked through lots of remains of a recent flash flood (sometimes 3ft deep ravines filled with rocks and sticks that cut through the trail).</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/17: (20.5 miles) Started off the day with a large uphill (did it at 6:30am to avoid the sun). Soon reached a junction to Yellow Jacket Spring (no Yellow Jackets), left my pack, and hiked 0.75 miles downhill to get a liter of water. Wasn't too hard, but had to hike back up that hill and that declared the little journey: not worth it. From then till lunch I was not in the mood for hiking (have I mentioned I hate the desert?) but convinced myself to carry on till about halfway before stopping for lunch. After lunch it was mostly a big downhill into Walker Pass where Trail Angels Rick and Rita took another hiker and me to their house for the night. She immediately cooked us plenty of spaghetti and we were stuffed! Also passed a major milestone- less than 2000 miles left to Canada!</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/18: (5.5 miles) Today we got blueberry pancakes for breakfast (yay for trail angels!). We made a stop at the Walker Pass campground with the trail angels to check the water cache and saw Matt and Lisa there! They joined us on the way to Onyx, where I picked up my boxes (tent stakes and a resupply) before we headed all the way to Lake Isabella (a much bigger town). I spent the rest of the time at the McDonald's eating McFlurrys and using the WiFi until my phone died (there wasn't anywhere to charge it there). Matt's boots are too small so they stayed in Lake Isabella and will try to find a place to get bigger boots. I headed out from Walker Pass Campground (saw a coyote just as I was leaving!) around 7pm and made it about 5.5 miles to a flat spot and decided the next feasible flat spot would be way too far away (around 6 miles).</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/19: (24.1 miles) again making up for the Nero of the day before. This is a new PR! Also a bunch of cool things happened today. First, I passed the 25% mark (I'm now closer to halfway than to Mexico!), then got to Joshua Tree spring and drank Uranium water (it's got more than the \"safe\" amount, but ok if you aren't drinking it all the time), then saw a bear on the trail&nbsp;about 100' away from me (it ran down the hillside through the brush as soon as I realized it was a bear)! Today had lots of big uphills and downhills in the sun, but I made it to Chimney Creek which had lots of clear, cool water. [Apparently something weird happened when trying to check in this night. Not sure what]</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/20: (21.4 miles) Kennedy Meadows! One of the most renowned names on the trail. After a brutal uphill in the heat and an even more brutal downhill (the downhill had no trees) I finally made it to the South Fork of the Kern River where I stopped for a bit to read and refill water bottles&nbsp;(some people took swims and such in the river). I was able to make it all the way to Kennedy Meadows and finally got to the General Store around 8pm. Made some dinner from hiker box Mac n Cheese (sketch- but it was fine) and hammocked on the porch because I was too tired to set up my tent.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/21: (10.4 miles) Hung out at the store most of the day. No cell service, WiFi, etc and the pay phone wasn't working. Got my bear canister, ice axe, and some new trekking poles! Was able to trade my bear canister for a smaller, lightweight one (1 lb less) with the General Store. Also sent my ice axe back home because there is next to no snow on the Sierras right now. Had M&amp;M pancakes for breakfast courtesy of the store's kitchen (and later I had a pretty decent burger too). Laundry and showers were spendy and not very good quality so I decided to skip it (besides- I had just taken a shower a couple days ago at a trail angel's). Headed out around 5:45pm aiming to avoid making today a Nero (again \"Near-Zero\": meaning single-digit miles for me)- and success! But that success meant getting in to camp at 10:45pm or so. Lots of glowing eyes staring at me through the forest but after lots of shouting at them I realized they were deer.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<br /></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n6/22: (18.1 miles) The meadow immediately outside my campsite was beautiful! Beck Meadow, I think (I wonder if Rebecca noticed that). Hiked today up a very steep hill to over 10,600 feet! The highest we've been so far on the PCT! The trek up was tough and took nearly all day. Downhill was much better and for the next couple of hours <em>everywhere</em> looked like a great campsite! I meant to do a couple more miles but ended up camping in Death Canyon where about 20 other hikers were also camping.<br />\n<br /><br />\n6/23: (~17 miles) In the Sierras, the mornings are always very cold (around 40°). This makes it harder to get up in the morning, but it's much better than having the sun beating down on your tent at 6:30am. Once I got all my stuff packed up I headed out around 8:20am (almost before anyone else left camp). It was more uphill back to 10,600 or so, but this time not as steep. More downhill again and we reached Diaz Creek where the next water of the day was. Because it was about 9 miles in, I had lunch here and just hung out for about 2.5 hours while other hikers showed up. About 4 miles later and the PCT met a trail junction to leave the trail and head to Lone Pine. Unfortunately, civilization's a ways away and it was about 4 miles of trail to the nearest parking lot, then 20-some miles that I hitched (all the way down the Sierras into Owen's Valley). I got to the Whitney Portal Hostel around 6:45pm or so and was finally able to catch up on some emails!</div>\n",

I'll try to update and re-post this as I get tired of other things or come across new ideas too.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>If you send me tortillas with a filling (like PB&amp;J or whatever), please, <em>please</em> don't pre-make the tortillas! These will be sitting in transition to the post office then at the post office for about <u>two weeks</u> (and by that time they're pretty soggy and gross). Just add some JIF To Go with some small jam packets (<a href=\"http://goo.gl/HHqcpV\">goo.gl/HHqcpV</a>) or whatever you want me to make the \"sandwich\" with. (And I think it'll take me a <em>long</em> time before I'm sick of PB&amp;J tortiallas)</li>\n<li>Also, some people have sent me things like peanut butter and jelly in little plastic cups. These cups aren't durable and split, crack, leak, you name it. Remember that whatever you send me will be transferred from the box to a flexible bag (containers have to be at least slightly flexible and durable).</li><li>If you send me something like a Pasta Side or Mac n Cheese that requires milk, please include the appropriate amount of instant milk</li>\n<li>If you send me instant milk <em>at all</em>, please tell me how to mix it (or include the instructions). I can guess&nbsp;and try to come up with a consistency that looks and tastes like milk, but telling me how much water to add makes it WAY easier</li>\n<li>Pancakes seem like a great idea (and, granted, if I had thought of them before I would've put them on my spreadsheet of meal ideas) and you can send them but they're probably the most difficult thing to cook (they're also hard to clean up but so is Mac n Cheese- which is too delicious to say no). I have a tiny, very thin pan that conducts heat like crazy. So I have to make very small pancakes (a couple inches in diameter) because each side cooks almost instantly. To be honest- if you send them I will probably either cook them right away while I'm in town or avoid cooking them until I absolutely must</li>\n<li>Tuna. Oh, man, tuna. I have pretty much exhausted my tolerance for tuna. Which is a shame because it's such a convenient way to get meat. If you send me tuna at this point- it's pretty much going straight into the closest hiker box. Sorry.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n</div>\n",

So I'm taking advantage of this time to do some updating.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n6/10: (11.6 miles) Hung around Hikertown for&nbsp;most of the day until LaughTrax (Matt), Rebel (Lisa), and Gummy Bear (Noah) (more about them later) showed up in the early afternoon. I decided to head out with them and we left just after 5 pm to night-hike the LA Aqueduct (most hikers do this because it's just a flat, boring section and to avoid the blistering Mojave heat). We camped just after the trail leaves the aqueduct for a bit (just to the side of a dirt road).<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n6/11: (19.8 miles) Today was originally planned to be ~15 miles (so we could do a 15 then a 13 to the closest place to hitch to Tehachapi). It was a long, horrendous hike in the Mojave sun amidst many wind turbines with very little shade. I was going very slow today&nbsp;(I blame the sun). Finally made it to the water source (3.5 miles before the campsite) and Gummy Bear told me that they were all planning on going up to the next campsite (4 miles farther up a fairly large hill). I got to the&nbsp;original campsite and after much thought (how steep is it really? how much closer to Tehachapi do I want to be?) I looked at the comments about the next tentsite on the Guthook app and they mentioned there was&nbsp;a water cache there. So I played some Christmas music (IT'S ALWAYS THE RIGHT TIME) and climbed into the sunset. The others weren't there (they did another 0.5 miles to the next spot) but the water was and I camped there.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n6/12: (9.5 miles) Headed out around 7:25 (a little late) and the others were still at the campsite further down. So I hiked the remaining 9 miles all downhill to Tehachapi Willow Springs Rd and after about 45 min we hitched with a couple who hardly spoke any English (fortunately Gummy Bear is fluent in Spanish due to his Mexican heritage so we were able to converse with them all the way to Tehachapi). They dropped us off at the Chinese Buffet and we got all-you-can-eat Chinese for $9.50! And all-you-can-drink water! I'm going to try to stay with a trail angel tonight and maybe zero tomorrow (we'll see...).",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">[I'm doing this one from my phone so these will probably be shorter than usual]</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/3: (15 miles) Hung out a bit more in Wrightwood at a PCT-friendly coffee shop till about 10 or so. A Christian counselor that had an office next door offered us rides to Inspiration Point and I shortly took him up on it. Hiked from Inspiration Point to the Grassy Hollow Visitor Center. As I stocked up on water I got interviewed by all the rangers, then by a group of 2nd graders who came by for a field trip. Hiked Mt. Baden-Powell (definitely the toughest part of the day) and camped at the Little Jimmy campground. We decided to hang our food for the first time tonight so that was fun.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/4: (17.7 miles) this may have seemed like a really big day if you checked my GPS data. I hiked 4.1 miles until I encountered Hwy 2 again, then hitched up about 4 miles until the PCT crossed Hwy 2 again. By doing so, I bypassed the endangered species closure for the Yellow-Legged Frog (for a freaking frog!). Passed mile 400 today! Again- hung food</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/5: (18.6 miles) Sun warmed up my tent today meaning that I was too late to get going. Hurriedly packed my stuff and ate breakfast in a shady spot down the trail. Got to the firehouse/ranger station and filled up on water, some electricity, and ate lunch. Lots of dodging Poodle Dog Bush to camp at Messenger Flats. Was feeling really lazy and instead of hanging food, I put it on top of the trash in one of the bear-proof garbage cans.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/6: (13.7 miles) hiked the easy 6 miles to the ranger station. This ranger station was selling ice cold sodas! Plus there was a very helpful volunteer (who provided all the PCT hiker goodness, has hiked the PCT 3 times, and looks a lot like John Goodman) that we talked to for a couple hours. After this point there was no more Poodle Dog Bush, but it was a very grueling and sweaty hike to the Acton KOA. I immediately paid the $15 to camp along with paying for a soda and ice cream sandwich. Picked up my box, then spent a couple hours lounging in my hammock. There were about 10 other hikers there and we talked until about hiker midnight (9 pm). One of the other hikers and I ordered a large pizza to the KOA and it was a super expensive $43!! Didn't sleep well at all in the hammock.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/7: (13.8 miles) the Mojave sun is relentless! Immediately from the KOA we hiked up hills in the sun with next to no shade. Eventually I made it to Vasquez Rocks State Park and was really itching to climb (again). Luckily, about 1 mile before Agua Dulce there was a guy and a girl about my age who walked up with a crash pad and wearing climbing shoes. They asked if I wanted to climb with them (would I ever!) and I put on the guy's shoes and did maybe 20 minutes of bouldering. Got their contact info and found out the girl works at Google! (maybe a future connection to get me in?) Shout out to Alan and Marie! Spent about 4 hours at the grocery store chilling with other hikers, eating ice cream, drinking Cactus Cooler, etc. Headed out later and camped just outside town. (Agua Dulce is one of 3 towns that the PCT goes through the middle of, in addition to Belden and Seiad Valley)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/8: (20.5 miles) got going at about 6 am. Some other hikers caught up to me just as I was about to leave and told me I should try to hit Casa de Luna (another trail angel's house) tonight. So that became the plan I pushed up hills and down hills in the horrendous Mojave sun to get there. A good bit more shade this time but still tough. Made it and am sleeping on one of the futons outside tonight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6/9: (Zero, but progress still made) tomorrow I will be doing what some other hikers have been doing and getting a ride to Hikertown. This will allow me to bypass the Powerhouse Fire closure without doing all the road walking. I'll stay there in Hikertown tomorrow night.</p>\n",

    "content": "5/29: (14.1 miles) Got a ride from the trail angel, Papa Smurf, I was staying with to the Fawnskin post office where my box was. Then he dropped me off at the Cougar Crest trail. After about 2 miles, the Cougar Crest trail took me to PCT mile 277.9. I stopped for lunch and after I finished two hikers came by. This is how the conversation went:<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Them: \"Hi, are you a through hiker?\"<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me: \"Yeah\" (and in an attempt to kick off introductions) \"I'm Derek\"<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Them: \"Derek! No way! We feel like we already know you! We've been following your blog!<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How's your foot?\"<br />\n<br />\nSo that was pretty cool! I hiked with them for a bit, then eventually they passed me (then I passed them the next morning). [If you guys are reading this, I'm sorry I don't believe I caught your names (or I forgot) otherwise I would mention you by name!]<br />\n<br />\nRebecca and I camped at about PCT mile 290 (we intended to go to 293 but it was getting dark). We have decided that my trail name is SuperTramp (after Chris McCandless) and hers is Gummy Child (because she once offered everyone Sour Patch Kids with the phrase \"would you like some gummy children?\").<br />\n<br />\n5/30: (20.2 miles) Felt like a very slow (and HOT! over 100!) day. I got going about 2 hours after Gummy Child and didn't see her again until the Hot Springs. Yes, I hiked to the first Hot Springs today (Deep Creek Hot Springs). \"Clothing Optional\" might as well say \"there will be a bunch of naked old dudes here\" so that was...interesting. Decided not to camp there- not because it was technically not allowed (people were doing it and all was well), but because I didn't want some sort of drug-fueled ruckus starting around midnight. So I left late and hiked until I found a good spot (which, unfortunately, wasn't for another 2.2 miles)<br />\n<br />\n5/31: (16.2 miles) another 100+° day! Unfortunately, I learned the hard way today that you should not run out of water in the desert. In the morning I was out of water for about half an hour (not too bad), but then again I was out of water much later for about 2 hours (or more). Water is by far the heaviest thing to carry (I usually carry around 2.75 L or just about 6 pounds). I can carry more, but it's obviously not going to be too comfortable (especially if I'm just out of a town carrying about 4-5 days of food). So I cut it really close with water this day (maybe too close) but I was fine and was able to camp by the lake that night.<br />\n<br />\n6/1: (15.4 miles) McDonald's day! The trail has many little surprises along the way and one is where the trail waltzes right up to I-15, within 0.4 miles of a McDonald's and a few small convenience stores. I ordered a Big Mac and large M&amp;M McFlurry (I dreamed about ice cream while hiking the last couple of days). I hung out there for a few hours, then decided to stay at the Best Western across the interstate. Their biggest discount on rooms was the PCT discount, so that was nice! Got a good shower and a good bed for the night.<br />\n<br />\n6/2: (0 miles hiked, but progress was still made) Wrightwood is where my next package was, so I had to get there. It's about 27.8 miles from Cajon Pass (where the McDonald's is). Unfortunately, those miles entail 5000 ft elevation gain, almost no water, and Poodle Dog Bush almost everywhere (the plant we're constantly warned about- like Poison Oak but worse, supposedly). I was also basically out of food (but could have bought more at the convenience stores). Wrightwood is a very PCT-friendly town and the hardware store keeps a list of all the trail angels and their contact info. They sent me this list and I was able to find someone to give me a ride from Cajon Pass to Wrightwood. Since then, I've got my package, eaten some food, and will be staying with another trail angel tonight before I reunite with the trail tomorrow. [I haven't hiked any PCT miles today but I still say \"progress was made\" because I jumped ahead 27.8 miles of trail]",

They're spendy but are...darn tough...and they have a lifetime guarantee)</li>\n<li>Lightweight clothes to hike in (remember- you will likely be in these clothes the <i>entire</i>&nbsp;time that you are with me. No showers or laundry guaranteed)</li>\n<li>Water bottles (I suggest Smart Water water bottles as they are very durable and fit my filter)</li>\n<li>A hat (and maybe bandanna) for sun protection</li>\n<li>Rain gear (I just have a rain jacket)</li>\n<li>A first-aid kit sufficient for you (plus whatever medication you might need and blister care items if your feet aren't entirely callous)</li>\n<li>Whatever you plan to eat out of (i.e. utensils and dish; I have a pot and pan to cook with that you can use)</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<u>Highly suggested:</u></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Trekking poles (depending on your height, you could borrow some from someone else or just use ski poles)</li>\n<li>Sleeping pad (depends how hardcore you are- you could theoretically use a windshield solar reflector as a cheap, lightweight, 3/4 length sleeping pad)</li>\n<li>Toilet Paper</li>\n<li>Headlamp</li>\n<li>Sunglasses</li>\n<li>Warm jacket (I'm using a primaloft jacket that is very lightweight but warm)</li>\n<li>Ibuprofen (the PCT hiker's favorite drug- I take at least 2 a day)</li>\n<li>An external battery pack if you're planning on bringing electronics like an iPod or whatever (an external battery pack is just good to have in everyday life anyway- buy one)</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<u>Optional:</u></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug headnet</li>\n<li>Warm gear (gloves, hat, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\nYou should also be able to hike at least 2.5 mph with around a 40 lb pack for a few hours at a time.

Coolest part was that we hiked from gloomy, foggy Idyllwild through the clouds to an amazing view of an ocean of clouds as far as you could see (photos will be uploaded soon if not already)<br />\n<br />\n5/24: (~20 miles) hiked to the famous trail angels Ziggy &amp; The Bear. We hiked about 16 miles downhill, then 4 miles through the desert in the fiercest winds I've ever been in (and I just graduated from 4 years of college in Ohio). Unfortunately, after lunch my foot <i>really</i>&nbsp;hurt and I limped the last 9 miles of the day (not fun downhill and in lots of wind). Got a box at Ziggy &amp; The Bear and camped on their back porch with a few other hikers<br />\n<br />\n5/25: (10 miles) hiked in the wicked desert to the oasis of the Whitewater Preserve. Plenty of people there on Memorial Day. Unfortunately- this was the worst day for my right foot. About halfway to the preserve (4 miles in) I felt a pop in my foot and it hurt way more than usual. <i>Very</i>&nbsp;painful 4 miles (again down a steep hill). Got to the preserve where there was plenty of shade and decided to stay there for the night (only 8 miles hiked at this point). David and Rebecca moved on and I set up my hammock and read my Kindle. After about 5 hours I decided I didn't want to make this a Nero (Nero: \"Near-Zero\"; to some people a single-digit day) so I hiked 2 more miles to make 10 miles. Camped next to Whitewater river<br />\n<br />\n5/26: (19.9 miles) hiked (again in the grueling desert) this day but it was a bit better- by 10am I hit Mission Creek and the remainder of the day was spent following Mission Creek (crossing over it multiple times). I carried very little water because I was so close to water all the time (only about 1.75 L) and that was nice on the shoulders. Took BIG breaks (couple 1 hour breaks and about 2 hours for lunch), which caused me to reach the campsite just barely before total darkness<br />\n<br />\n5/27: (12.2 miles) easy hike. Got up later than usual (6am) and got going later than usual (7:30am). Was told that I could hitchhike from Onyx Summit to Big Bear (where my original plan was to hike almost all the way around Big Bear Lake to the Cougar Crest Trail at PCT mile 277.9. This would fortunately cut a couple days out of my schedule. Hiked all day (lots of up and down) and finally came to a sign at the Onyx Summit made by some trail angels with a water cache (these trail angels weren't mentioned in any other information that I've seen so it was a surprise). Called them and I'm staying tonight at the house of Papa Smurf and Mountain Mama in Big Bear (they gave me a ride from the trail). This place is great! Not only do we get a place to sleep, but I get to use this computer, a shower, laundry, and food all free of charge (I'm adding to their donation box, of course)!<br />\n<br />\n5/28 [anticipated]: (0 miles) planning to take my first zero tomorrow. Gonna rest my foot, explore Big Bear a bit, do laundry, get my box from the Fawnskin post office (planned there instead of Big Bear because it'd be closer to the Cougar Crest Trail). Also probably will meet up with Rebecca and David for lunch or something tomorrow (they're also taking zeros). May even join them for more trail!",

Last year some hikers attempted to cross through the closure and were fined $2,500 each. There is an official detour but it involves a lot of road walking and a very small campground. To avoid that, many hikers are hitchhiking the 17 miles from the Paradise Cafe to Idyllwild. David, Rebecca and I have done that and are staying in a hotel in <u>Idyllwild</u> tonight (we were lucky to get a room on Memorial Day weekend) and will be hiking the Deer Spring Trail and rejoining the PCT at mile 183 tomorrow.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">5/18: (14 miles) hitchhiked out of Julian at about noon. But first had free PCT pie a la mode at Mom's Pies (youtu.be/Wo89Fdo_-14). Lots of uphill, but got my music going and hit about 3.2mph at some points! Almost stepped on a rattlesnake! Camped at a water cache.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/19: (17.7 miles) hiked to a campsite just before Warner Springs. Went from very high elevation to bare desert meadows in the hot sun to small forest oases next to rivers. This day marked one week on the trail!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/20: (11.8 miles) hiked the extremely long 0.5 miles to Warner Springs. The Resource Center caters a lot to hikers. They were supposed to open at 8, but didn't open till around 11. Picked up a box at the post office and used the Resource Center's computer to catch up on emails. Left at 2 pm and hiked until dark.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/21: (19.2 miles) hiked 7 miles to a place called Trail Angel Mike's. Really it was just some guy's run down, hoarder-like, and garbage-filled house. Mike wasn't home and it was really sketch. Met up with Rebecca (who had left camp an hour before me that morning) and also saw David (who I hadn't seen since the day before). David left just as I got to Mike's and I didn't see him till the next day. We hiked to Nance Canyon and camped near there.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/22: (11.7 miles) didn't get enough water at Tule Spring the night before so realized I had very little water this morning. Hiked half a mike back to a nearly empty water cache to get about 0.25 liters (not really worth it). Then rationed the water as I hiked in, through, all around, and above (preposition party!) Nance Canyon. Rebecca had once again left an hour before I but I met up with her and David at a cool little water cache. We then hiked into the clouds (literally)- up and up and up. Then over the ridge and up to the highway where we were picked up and taken to the Paradise Cafe (fantastic burger and Bundaberg ginger beer!). There we decided to skip the detour around the fire closure and hitchhike all the way into Idyllwild for a hotel again! (More on that soon)<br>\n</p>\n",

    "title": "Summary thus far",
    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">I have gotten some questions about mileage. Here's a brief synopsis of each day thus far:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/13: (20 miles) hiked from Campo, CA to Lake Morena. Camped at the campground. Tough first day at 80&#176; or so with a big hill climb</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/14: (19 miles) hiked from Lake Morena to mile 39. Was about 55&#176; or colder. High elevation, hiking through the clouds. Stopped once rain picked up to set up tent around 4 pm. Cooked dinner then attempted to sleep. Tent was leaky</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/15: (~3 miles) woke up with tent in the snow. Was snowing and raining at about 6000' on Mt. Laguna. Quickly packed up the wet gear and just decided to power through the weather to the town. Took a couple hours where I was freezing and soaked to the bone. Got to the Pine House Tavern where a bunch of other hikers (about 27) were waiting out the weather we ate food there and slept on the floor that night. Got my first resupply and bought a new tent that was 1 lb lighter and actually waterproof! But the upgrade cost a small fortune of $550.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/16: (18.5 miles) pretty easy day from the tavern, spending the morning hiking through woods that resembled Oregon or Washington. Then suddenly on the edge of some cliffs opening to the desert down below. Spent the rest of the day hiking the edges around the desert&#160; </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5/17: (18 miles) really tough day. Up in the 80&#176;s the majority of the day. After about the first hour, descended rapidly (painful on the knees) about 900', then immediately ascending about that same elevation. Spent the rest of the day hiking under the hot sun in a total desert. Got bad sunburn on my hands. At mile 77, hitchhiked with the guy and girl I'm hiking with to Julian, CA (At lunch we reserved a hotel for the night for us). Luckily, within about 5 min a nice old lady picked us up. The main reason for hitching to Julian is that the next reliable water source from when we got water around lunch time at mile 68.4 is at mile 101. Also there's a shop here that has free pie for PCT hikers :)</p>\n",

I'll try to post real stories and updates every time I resupply. In addition- I'm going to attempt to set up a system that will post every night with the GPS coordinates of where I am camping for that night.<br />\n<br />\nSecondly, if you would like to help with my adventure, I could use some help with my resupply boxes. I have set up a spreadsheet with a list of meal ideas, how many required, where to send them, etc. If you feel so inclined, you can sign up to pack and send me one of these boxes at <a href=\"http://pctresupply.derekantrican.com/\">pctresupply.derekantrican.com</a> . The instructions should be clear, but if not- please send me an email at derekantrican@gmail.com . (I don't expect all of you to send me a box))<br />\n<br />\nFinally, prayer for this trip would be much appreciated. Please pray that God keeps my confidence up and that I can be an emblem of him on this journey. Please also pray for a couple main worries I have on this trip- that I can achieve the goals set by my schedule (I have to start a job on Oct 16 and have to be back in Ohio for that), that the food for my trip is enough so that I don't lose too much weight, and that God keeps the wild animals (particularly bears) at bay.<br />\n<br />\nThank you!

Now usually hikers use <a href=\"http://trailjournal.com/\">trailjournal.com</a>&nbsp;for their hiking journals and to share their gear, but I have decided to use blogger as I can connect it to a variety of different automation services to post in creative ways (via SMS, for instance). TrailJournal also doesn't have a mobile app and since I'll have my phone with me, I'll be likely using the mobile app to post.<br />\n<br />\nCheck out the sidebar (yeah, over there on the right!) to follow updates by email or to see my gear list (via <a href=\"http://geargrams.com/\">geargrams.com</a>) or to see a detailed spreadsheet of resupply locations, hiking distances, and other information. Keep in mind that at this stage both of these links are very much a work in progress.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, if you'd like to send me a resupply box, that'd be great! Let me know and I'll give you a list of the things I'm buying and a proper address and such to send it to. (By Christmas I plan to have the spreadsheet updated with at least 5 different types of boxes, fully planned out with what should go in each. So if you wish to send me a box during my hike, it should be super easy at that point.)",

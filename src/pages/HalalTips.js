  # Tips on making a dish Halal

  If you are making a dish to bring to a Muslim's house or a potluck with Muslims, you should make it Halal so that they can freely enjoy it!

  This site is a great overview of what constitutes Halal, the purpose behind it, etc: https://www.icv.org.au/about/about-islam-overview/what-is-halal-a-guide-for-non-muslims 

  Here are some quick tips:
  - Avoid any pork or pig products (eg ham, bacon fat, etc)
  - If your dish contains meat, purchase meat from a Halal market (reference Google Maps)
    - Seafood is always halal! (but not everyone likes seafood üôÇ)
  - Use vegetable broth or Halal bouillon instead of meat broth
  - If your dish does not contain meat, watch out for some of the following Haram (non-Halal) ingredients:
    - Gelatin (marshmallows, jello, etc)
    - Alcohol/fermented ingredients (some salad dressings, some BBQ sauces, some mustards, vanilla extract*, etc)
      - ‚ÄúWhite/Red wine vinegar‚Äù is usually fine, but any other mention of ‚Äúwine‚Äù, ‚Äúcharddonay‚Äù, etc is probably not
    - Whey or animal rennet (some cheeses - most common cheeses should be fine, but you can call the company to verify they use vegetable rennet)
    - Shortening/lard (a lot of times shortening is plant-based, but good to double-check)
  - If looking for Halal food/ingredients online a couple sites you can use are:
    - [halalworlddepot.com](https://halalworlddepot.com) (they will ship Halal frozen turkeys, burgers, hotdogs, etc)
    - [basilgrocery.com](https://basilgrocery.com)
    - [smyrnamarketseattle.com](https://smyrnamarketseattle.com) (local to Seattle)
  - If you are unsure, you can often Google ‚Äúis _____ halal‚Äù, or ask a Muslim!


  *Although the rules about alcohol typically apply to ‚Äúcan you get drunk from it‚Äù, some Muslims still consider vanilla extract to not be Halal because it contains a small
  amount of alcohol. The Islamic Food And Nutrition Council Of America says it is Halal, but each individual has their own ‚Äústrictness‚Äù. You can get alcohol-free Vanilla
  extract at Whole Foods.*

  Of course, every Muslim is different in how they observe Islam and especially ‚ÄúHalal‚Äù. One Muslim may be fine eating anything (even non-Halal meats like beef/chicken/etc)
  as long as it's not pork. Another Muslim may be very strict in their observance, buying nothing from an American grocery store and only shopping at Mediterranean/Halal
  markets. Ultimately: ask the person you are making something for to determine what their observance is.
